Often, a refrac is motivated by a level of production that has declined, usually to or below an economic limit. In some cases, a refrac may boost production to a higher level and make the well economic again.\\n[0003]\\nWell re-stimulation treatments usually involve a well with pre-existing perforations as well as new perforations that may be added as a part of the re-stimulation treatment. There is usually no hydraulic isolation device inside the wellbore. Diversion techniques, such as, for example, BROADBAND SEQUENCEª treatment and/or the diverters disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,036,587, U.S. Pat. No. 7,267,170, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,905,133, enable multistage fracturing treatment without using isolation devices inside the wellbore. However, the stage design for refracs applying diversion techniques remains as a considerable challenge to the industry, which must meet at least two criteria. First, the cause(s) of subpar production must be identified and the treatment must be designed to address the cause(s). For examples, the subpar production may be due to premature damage of the producing fractures, which we may refer to as Òold fracturesÓ, and the treatment would be designed to restore conductivity in the old fractures, which may involve refracturing the old fractures, which we may refer to herein as ÒrefracturesÓ; or the subpar production may be due to insufficient contact with the rock and unexpectedly low reservoir drainage volume, in which case the refrac would focus on developing new fractures in rock that was not fractured in the previous treatment, which we may also refer to herein as Ònew rockÓ.\\n[0004]\\nThe second criterion is that the overall treatment cost must respect the economic constraints and be proportional to the production improvement, viz., it is not realistic to use sophisticated completion systems, excessive amounts of sand, fracturing fluid additives, or other stimulating material, and/or excessive horsepower, i.e., an unrealistic number of fracturing pumps.\\n[0005]\\nPrevious efforts have focused on refrac candidate recognition, i.e., the selection of wells suitable for refrac, such as in L. P. Moore et al., ÒRestimulation: Candidate Selection Methodologies and Treatment OptimizationÓ, SPE 102681 (2006), and R. E. Barba, ÒA Novel Approach to Identifying Refracturing Candidates and Executing Refracture Treatments in Multiple Zone ReservoirsÓ, SPE 125008-MS (2009); or on refrac techniques using fracturing slurry stages and diverters, such as in M. Craig et al., ÒBarnett Shale Horizontal Restimulations: A Case Study of 13 WellsÓ, SPE 154669 (2012), and D. I. Potapenko, ÒBarnett Shale Refracture Stimulations Using a Novel Diversion TechniqueÓ, SPE 119636 (2009).\\n[0006]\\nThe industry has an ongoing need for the development or improvement of methods to design and execute refracturing treatments in accordance the above criteria.\\nSUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE\\n[0007]\\nIn one aspect, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a method to design and execute refracturing treatments, for a wide range of treatment types. In some embodiments, the refracturing strategy comprises pumping stages of fracturing fluid separated by diversion pills to isolate a region of the wellbore and direct the fracturing fluid to particular locations or regions along the wellbore. In some embodiments, a workflow is developed to place proppant in old fractures and/or fractures in new rock via a previously hydraulically fractured wellbore, according to the depletion status of the well and applicable economic constraints, if any. In some embodiments, the instantaneous shut in pressure values (ISIPs) of the old fractures, the refractures, the new fractures in new rock, or a combination thereof, are used to guide the stage design and the execution of the refrac treatment. In some embodiments, various realizations of the workflow are presented, depending on the availability of data, tools, and resources.\\n[0008]\\nIn some embodiments, pore pressure and cluster stresses are optionally determined at a start of the treatment, and goal ISIPs, corresponding to undepleted regions of the formation, and target ISIPs versus treatment progression or stage, beginning with the depleted regions, are developed. In some embodiments, the diversion and proppant pumping schedules are designed, based on different levels of available information and simulating tools, and the refracturing treatment is initiated accordingly.

In some embodiments, it is desired that the refracturing treatment of the present disclosure create effective fractures in undepleted previously fractured regions and/or new rock, where the pore pressure is close to the initial reservoir pressure; create short and wide fractures in moderately depleted regions, where the initial fractures have lost most conductivity in the near wellbore area; and create little no fractures in the most depleted regions. Therefore, in some embodiments herein, the method aims to place most, e.g., >50%, of the proppant mass in the undepleted regions, in fractures.\\n[0084]\\nThe degree of depletion may be directly represented by the magnitude of reservoir pore pressure, which is reflected in the formation stress, e.g., there is a correlation between stress and pore pressure, as in the following Equation (1):\\nð\\n_\\n=\\n[\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\nð\\n1\\n-\\nð\\n_\\n)\\n-\\n1\\n]\\n_\\nð\\n_\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n(\\n1\\n)\\nwhere _h is the formation stress, pr is reservoir pore pressure, Eh and Ev are the horizontal and vertical Young's moduli, _h and _v are the horizontal and vertical Poisson's ratios, and is the poroelastic constant. In hydraulic fracturing, the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) is closely related to the magnitude of the stress, and is thus used in some embodiments herein as a proxy for pore pressure. In some embodiments herein, the present disclosure uses ISIP as a key parameter in stage design, implementation and/or in real time diagnosis of effectiveness of refrac treatments.\\n[0085]\\nIn particular embodiments, the ISIPs of the initial fracture treatment are used to set the threshold or goal for ISIPs in the refracturing treatment of undepleted regions. With reference to FIG. 1, there is usually a range between lower and upper ISIP bounds 10, 12 of the initial fracture treatment. In some embodiments, the lower bound 10 is the minimum goal value desired to be achieved in the refrac treatment, as this ISIP value represents the stress, and hence, pore pressure in the undepleted region. On the other hand, the ISIP 14 of the first refrac treatment stage represents the lowest stress, and hence the most depleted region. For example, the ISIP 14 can be measured by conducting an injection test of a small volume of fluid, since it can be assumed the injection fluid will initially enter the lowest stress or most depleted zone.\\n[0086]\\nBecause of the usual heterogeneity of rock properties along a horizontal wellbore and uneven depletions from the initial fractures, the stresses at the clusters are not uniform. When the pumping starts in a refrac treatment, the pressure inside the wellbore increases, and fractures are created in the first stage from the perf clusters that have the lowest stresses, following the principle of least resistance. In the subsequent stages, using a diversion technique in some embodiments, fractures are created from clusters of increasingly high stresses, and hence in less depleted regions. In some embodiments as shown in FIG. 2, this workflow allows different ISIP progressions 16, 18, 20 from low ISIP 14 to high ISIP 10, 12, to create an effective treatment and at the same time, take the risk of screenout into account. For example, if ISIP progression 16 represents the ISIP values versus stage for the upfront stimulation of the initial fracture treatment, ISIP progression 18 represents a relatively aggressive refrac with only a few stages targeting low-ISIP depleted zones, e.g., 6-7 stages, and many stages targeting the undepleted regions, e.g., 13-14 stages; whereas ISIP progression 20 is a more conservative refrac with relatively more low-ISIP stages, e.g., 14 stages, and fewer high-ISIP stages, e.g., 6 stages.\\n[0087]\\nThe following description herein is based on the use of a diverter such as BROADBAND SEQUENCEª treatment by way of example and illustration, but the method is not so limited and can also be used with other placement methods, such as, for example, ball sealers, sleeves, and so on.\\n[0088]\\nWith reference to FIG. 3, an overview of workflow 100 for a refrac stage design and implementation in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. In task 110, a goal range of ISIP values (cf. 10, 12 in FIG. 1) for the refracturing treatment of a well is established, e.g., the minimum and maximum ISIPs of the upfront or initial multistage fracture treatment of the well from the previous or original stimulation can be used. The goal range represents ISIP values corresponding to an undepleted region(s) of the formation. The minimum ISIP in this range provides a reference for the magnitude of ISIP for fracturing into the undepleted region of the well. The maximum ISIP in the goal range provides an upper limit of the ISIP for fracturing in this well. If a refracturing treatment stage has an ISIP higher than this upper limit, a screenout may occur and require remedial steps.\\n[0089]\\nIn task 120, pore pressure and cluster stresses along the well at a start of the re-stimulation treatment are determined. Various methods and models can be used, depending on the available information and tools, some embodiments of which are elaborated in more detail below in reference to FIGS. 8-10. In general embodiments, the mechanical property values for the formation along a lateral of the well for Equation (1), e.g., Poisson's ratios and Young's moduli, can be taken from logs, e.g., sonic logs, or estimated from offset or pilot wells in the formation, and so on. Pore pressures can be measured or determined from production history and/or simulations. For example, it can be assumed the pore pressure in the reservoir was uniform prior to any production, and an initial stress distribution can be calculated along the lateral using Equation (1). The pore pressure at the start of the refrac can be measured, estimated, simulated based on previous treatment parameters and production history, and so on. The current reservoir pressure field can then be calculated, which represents the depletion state in the various regions of the reservoir. Using this pore pressure field, and because stress is a function of pore pressure, the current stress field can then be calculated from a geomechanics simulation, e.g., 1D or 3D, using Equation (1), for example.\\n[0090]\\nIn operation 130, target ISIP values versus treatment progression, e.g., stage by stage, are established. The target ISIP values may range from a minimum target ISIP value equal to or greater than a lowest pore pressure in the formation corresponding to depleted regions (cf. 14 in FIG. 1) at a start of the re-stimulation treatment, i.e., the first stage, and a maximum target ISIP value within the goal range of ISIP values (cf. 10, 12 in FIG. 1) corresponding to the undepleted regions at an end of the re-stimulation treatment, i.e., the last or ultimate stages. These target ISIP values may also have minimum and maximum bounds for each stage representing a band of uncertainty within which the target ISIP value is deemed to have been met. If desired, the low bound of the planned ISIP profile can be verified or adjusted as needed, by conducting an injection test of a small volume of fluid to measure an ISIP, before or at the start of the refracturing treatment.\\n[0091]\\nNext, a diversion strategy is designed in operation 140 and a proppant pumping schedule in operation 150. The designs in operations 140, 150, can be obtained separately in either order or simultaneously, or as part of a joint design. Operation 140 involves setting the proposed diversion target profile, e.g., the number of stages, the diversion squeeze rate, and the diversion pill volume of each stage in which a diverter is used. The diverter may or may not be used in the ultimate stage, but is usually used in at least the first through penultimate stages. Operation 150 involves setting the pumping schedule for the propped fracture treatment, e.g., the pump rate, the pad fluid volume, the proppant concentration ramp or loading schedule, and the total proppant placement for each stage. Proppant is normally pumped in each stage to hold the fracture open, however, stage steps in which no proppant is used are nevertheless deemed to be a part of the proppant pumping schedule. The diversion strategy and proppant pumping schedule can be developed using various methods and models, depending on the available data and tools, some embodiments of which are discussed below in reference to FIGS. 4-7.\\n[0092]\\nNext, the refrac treatment initiation 160 uses the proppant pumping schedule from 150 and the diversion schedule from 140. In task 170, an ISIP value is obtained following diversion at the end of the stages where it is used, compared to the target ISIP for that stage, and if necessary or desired, e.g., if it differs from the target ISIP value determined in 130 by an unsatisfactory margin, e.g., a predetermined amount, subsequent stages are adjusted in real time and/or redesigned during the refrac treatment to better meet the target ISIP in the subsequent stages, e.g., in proportion to the difference between the measured and target ISIP values. Some embodiments of the refrac initiation 160 and redesign task 170 are described below in reference to FIG. 12.\\n[0093]\\nThe embodiments shown in FIG. 4, wherein correspondence in the last two digits of the reference numerals with those in FIG. 3 indicate corresponding but not necessarily identical elements, illustrate another workflow 200 for the refrac stage design and implementation. The workflow 200 includes refrac simulation operation 202 using a refrac simulator, such as, for example, the BBSCFR simulator available from Schlumberger Technology Corporation, or another refrac simulator. The refrac simulator in some embodiments is a fast computer program that can determine fracture initiation, flow rate distribution, and perforation cluster plugging by diverter, with computations based on mass and momentum conservation and an algorithm that expands on the calculations for limited entry that were described in K. Wutherich et al., ÒDesigning completions in horizontal shale gas wellsÑperforation strategiesÓ, SPE 155485 (2012), to calculate the flow distribution along a wellbore interval.\\n[0094]\\nIn some embodiments, inputs to the refrac simulator in operation 202 may include one or more or all of the completion parameters, cluster design, estimated fracturing gradient per cluster, the amount of diverting material required to plug one perforation, the total amount of diversion pumped in the diverting pill, and so on. In some embodiments, the refrac simulation 202 functions in a 3-step sequence: (1) computation of the flow rate across each perforation cluster during a stage, and then before any diversion material is pumped at the rate at which the diverting pill is squeezed through the perforations, e.g., 20 bbl/min, along with the wellbore pressure required to flow fluid across the perforations; (2) computation of the perforation plugging progression (fraction of perforations plugged) to consume the material pumped in the diverting pill, which may be based on user input of the quantity of material required to plug a perforation, the size of the diverting pill, the squeeze rate, and so on; (3) with a fraction of the perforations plugged, computation of the flow rate across each perforation cluster at the squeezing rate (e.g., 20 bbl/min), and then at the fracturing rate of the subsequent fracturing stage. Steps 1, 2, 3 in some embodiments are employed for a single fracture simulation, or iterated for the number of fracturing stages to be pumped in the treatment.\\n[0095]\\nIn some embodiments, the refrac simulation 202 may ignore one or more or all of the fracture-initiation pressure, the fracture propagation and geometry, the changes in the net pressures of the fractures during diversion, and so on. While these limitations may affect a level of accuracy, they do not impair the ability to sensitize on inputs and draw valuable conclusions. In particular, the simulator can be used to understand one or more or all of the effect of stress variations along a wellbore interval on the value of the diversion pressure, the relative change in ISIP values, the number of clusters taking fluid, and so on.\\n[0096]\\nThe cluster design in some embodiments may be characterized by one or more or all of: number of perforations, perforations diameter, perforation coefficient, spacing from the next cluster, fracturing gradient of the zone adjacent to the cluster, and so on.\\n[0097]\\nIn the workflow 200, the goal ISIPs are established in task 210 and the cluster stresses determined in operation 220 as in FIG. 3, and as described in more detail in reference to FIGS. 8-10. Next, the establishment of the goal ISIPs in operation 230 is subsumed in diversion design operation 240, and based on the cluster stresses and an initial pill stage design input 241, the refrac simulation 202 calculates the number and location of the clusters where fractures are initiated for the pill of each stage. The results 242 provide the number of clusters of each stage and the minimum cluster stress vs. stage. In some embodiments, the minimum cluster stress vs. stage can be used as a proxy to calculate the ISIP vs. stage result in operation 230, since stress is usually one order of magnitude larger than the difference between ISIP and stress, viz., net pressure. In some other embodiments, an estimated fracture net pressure input 244, e.g., approximately 1.4-7 MPa (200-1000 psi) can be added to the minimum cluster stresses to obtain ISIPs.\\n[0098]\\nThe calculated ISIP vs stage curve from 230 can be compared with the diversion target profile in decision operation 246. If the progression of ISIP for all the stages matches the target or within an acceptable deviation, the pill stage design is completed in output 248. If not, the pill volume of certain stages can be modified for input 241, and the refrac simulation 202 repeated until the target is met.\\n[0099]\\nIn the proppant schedule design operation 250, the stage ISIPs are divided into groups in task 251. In some embodiments, two or three or more groups may be used, e.g., low, middle, and high ISIP value groups. In some embodiments, a decision to split the stages into 2 or 3 groups depends on the gap in values of the stresses along the wellbore. For example, if there is a clear gap between the low stress (depleted region) ISIPs and high stress (undepleted region) ISIPs such as in the Example below (see FIG. 13), then only two groups are necessary, although 3 or more groups may also be selected. The high ISIP stages group form a plateau in the ISIP vs. stage curve (see FIG. 11) curve, representing a larger number of stages in the high stress, undepleted regions.\\n[0100]\\nFor each group, an average number of clusters per stage can be obtained from the results 242. From this and a total proppant mass input 252, which represents the main cost of a refracturing treatment, an initial proppant pump schedule for a single cluster can be designed for each group in task 253. Single fracture simulations 254 are conducted for each group, and representative fracture geometry and conductivity outputs 255 are obtained for each group. The fracture geometry and conductivity are compared with the target values in each group in decision operation 256. If the comparison is satisfactory, the proppant pump schedule design is completed in output 258. If not, the proppant pump schedules are modified in 254 and the fracture simulations 255 are repeated until the target is met. Then the refrac initiation 260 and real-time adjustments 270 are carried out as discussed in reference to FIG. 3 and/or FIG. 12.\\n[0101]\\nIn the embodiments shown for workflow 300 in FIG. 5, wherein correspondence in the last two digits of the reference numerals\", 'top_terms': \"['isip', 'stages', 'treatment', 'diversion', 'proppant', 'clusters', 'stage', 'target', 'schedule', 'groups']\", 'embedding': '[-0.0844318, -0.25852945, -0.08592723, 0.072669856, -0.21005154, 0.08090977, 0.02781749, -0.11105874, 0.03865819, -0.14935076, 0.098452486, -0.09052102, 0.19386636, 0.07930713, -0.005457101, -0.03750686, 0.15404506, -0.0011284136, -0.03763745, 0.09244869, 0.24372411, -0.03168814, 0.008350774, -0.13581617, 0.21828184, 0.14190379, 0.09308472, 0.09153748, 0.12151121, -0.09262976, 0.04912211, 0.029370375, 0.04975908, -0.15439484, -0.05484174, -0.11421129, 0.02710805, -0.22500901, -0.020467667, 0.011319247, -0.19638222, -0.3689039, 0.14779817, -0.17604521, -0.17562725, -0.1379623, 0.18755598, 0.100430444, -0.051369872, 0.0060468116, 0.009279059, -0.011198979, 0.19889423, -0.10336409, 0.040949333, 0.1616493, -0.033087574, -0.060800087, -0.07616176, 0.0021712738, 0.02485609, 0.076094404, -0.14743754, 0.044055715]', 'cpc': 'E21B41/0092, G06Q10/06, E21B49/008, E21B43/26, E21B43/267, E21B49/00, G01V20/00, G01V99/005', 'definitions': 'Methods relating to program engineering, design or optimisation, Resources, workflows, human or project management; Enterprise or organisation planning; Enterprise or organisation modelling, Testing the nature of borehole walls; Formation testing; Methods or apparatus for obtaining samples of soil or well fluids, specially adapted to earth drilling or wells by injection test; by analysing pressure variations in an injection or production test, e.g. for estimating the skin factor, Methods for stimulating production by forming crevices or fractures, Methods for stimulating production by forming crevices or fractures reinforcing fractures by propping, Testing the nature of borehole walls; Formation testing; Methods or apparatus for obtaining samples of soil or well fluids, specially adapted to earth drilling or wells, , Geomodels or geomodelling, not related to particular measurements', 'forward cites': nan, 'backward cites': nan}), Document(page_content='US-2017269262-A1', metadata={'abstract': 'Consolidated porous media samples and methods for their manufacture are described herein.

The subject disclosure has particular use in enabling analysis and modeling of enhanced oil recovery in fractured systems although it is not limited thereto.\\nBACKGROUND\\n[0003]\\nIn studying the production of hydrocarbons from a rock formation, physical models of the rock formation have been generated. In particular, media constructed with borosilicate glass beads of varying sizes have been utilized. The borosilicate glass beads are sintered and the resulting glass construct is used as a replica of the formation rock. Fluids of matching refractive indices have been introduced into the glass construct, and because the glass construct is translucent or transparent, the flow of fluid may be visualized. In this manner, the flow of hydrocarbons through a formation may be studied. By way of example only, hydrocarbon fluid may be introduced into the glass construct, and then a brine may be introduced under desired pressure in order to study the displacement of the hydrocarbon by the brine in the glass construct.\\nSUMMARY\\n[0004]\\nThis summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.\\n[0005]\\nIllustrative embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a physical model of an earth formation. The physical model includes a sintered construct with pores. The sintered construct defines at least one fracture and/or channel extending at least partially through the sintered construct. The sintered construct is formed from beads of multiple sizes.\\n[0006]\\nVarious embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a method for generating a physical model of an earth formation. The method includes suspending at least one thin fracture and/or channel-sized chemically-dissolvable material in a hollow structure. The method further includes filling the hollow structure around the thin material with beads of varying sizes. The beads have a softening temperature below the softening temperature of the hollow structure. The method also includes subjecting the filled hollow structure to a temperature at or above the softening temperature of the beads and below the softening temperature of the hollow structure in order to sinter the beads within the hollow structure. Then, the method includes introducing a solvent into the sintered construct in order to dissolve the thin material and define at least one fracture or channel in the sintered construct. When the thin material is a sheet of material, the result of the dissolving of the thin material will be a fracture, and when the thin material is a thin wire, the result will be a channel.\\n[0007]\\nIn one embodiment, the hollow structure is a quartz tube which may be rectangular or round in cross section, the beads are borosilicate glass, and the chemically-dissolvable material is a metal, such as copper, zinc or tin. In another embodiment, the hollow structure is a borosilicate glass tube, the beads are soda-lime glass, and the chemically-dissolvable material is a metal sheet or wire.\\n[0008]\\nAdditional aspects, embodiments, objects and advantages of the disclosed methods may be understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the provided drawings.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n[0009]\\nFIG. 1 is diagram of an apparatus for generating a physical model of an earth formation.\\n[0010]\\nFIG. 2 is a three-dimensional rendering of a physical model of a formation with a sintered construct defining a fracture generated using the apparatus of FIG. 1.\\n[0011]\\nFIG. 3 is a three dimensional rendering of a physical model of an earth formation with a sintered construct that defines a channel.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\\n[0012]\\nThe particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the examples of the subject disclosure only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the subject disclosure. In this regard, no attempt is made to show details in more detail than is necessary, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the subject disclosure may be embodied in practice. Furthermore, like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.\\n[0013]\\nFor purposes herein, a ÒfractureÓ means a continuous void space defined in a construct of sintered beads, where the continuous void space is at least one hundred times larger than the average pore size defined between the sintered beads in at least two directions (when the fracture is generally planar), and at least twice the average pore size in a third, typically vertical, direction. This forms the ÒapertureÓ of the fracture. For nonplanar fractures, the two directions are understood to be locally tangential and the third direction is locally orthogonal to the tangential directions. The coordinates may be generalized curvilinear coordinates.\\n[0014]\\nAs will be described below, the surface of the fracture will be defined by a material (e.g., sheet or wire) that survives a softening temperature to which the beads are subjected in order to sinter the beads.\\n[0015]\\nAlso, for purposes herein, a ÒchannelÓ means a continuous void space defined in the construct of sintered beads, where the continuous void space is at least one hundred times larger than the average pore size between sintered beads in one direction, and at least twice the average pore size in second and third directions. In some embodiments, channels are generally substantially cylindrical.\\n[0016]\\nFurthermore, for purposes herein, Òsoftenining temperatureÓ means the temperature at which a material begins to measurably deform. In the case of glass beads, a temperature above the softening temperature will be sufficient to bond the beads to one another.\\n[0017]\\nIn one aspect, it will be appreciated that many hydrocarbon reservoirs are located in earth formations that are naturally fractured as a result of variability in rock strength and in situ stress. Variations in strength are generally due to differences in mineralogy, diagenesis, and cementation. During hydrocarbon production, the hydrocarbons within the fractures of carbonate rocks are also preferentially displaced if the matrix does not spontaneously imbibe the injected brine. Study of fractured systems can be important for evaluating efficient methods of hydrocarbon recovery. The embodiments described hereinafter provide physical models of rock formations containing fractures and/or channels, and methods of forming the same.\\n[0018]\\nAs seen in FIG. 1, a quartz tube 10 of desired cross-section (e.g., 12 mm_12 mm) and desired length (e.g., approximately 76 mm) is positioned on a rigid platform 15. Inside the tube 10 are borosilicate glass beads 20 of specified sizes (e.g., 100 micron, 80 micron, 70 micron, and 60 micron) and volume fractions which in one embodiment are randomly packed inside the tube. Running inside the tube is a thin copper sheet 30 of desired thickness (e.g., approximately 0.5 mm) and desired width and length (e.g., 10 mm_76 mm), and the beads 20 are packed inside the tube 10 and about the sheet 30.\\n[0019]\\nIn one embodiment, the open end(s) of the tube 10 are closed by high temperature blocks 40 with the beads 20 and sheet 30 in place and the assembly of the blocks 40, tube 10, beads 20 and sheet 30 is placed in a furnace. The furnace temperature which was set to approximately 800¡ C., and is then slowly (e.g., over a period of at least five, ten or fifteen minutes or more) brought up to the softening temperature for the borosilicate glass beads (e.g., approximately 830¡ C.) and held thereabouts for a desired amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes) to permit sintering of the beads 20. The assembly is then either removed from the furnace, or the furnace temperature is cooled gradually, resulting in a sintered construct defining numerous pores and that is similar in various respects to consolidated sandstone, except that it contains the copper sheet 30 suspended therein. One or both of blocks 40 are then removed from the assembly, and the sintered construct is soaked in a solvent such as nitric acid or ferric chloride that dissolves the copper sheet but that does not materially impact the sintered construct. The solvent may then be drained into a collector (not shown) and the sintered construct which now defines a fracture where the copper sheet was located may be flushed with a distilled deionized water. After multiple pore volumes of flushing, the fractured sintered construct may be dried (e.g., in vacuum).\\n[0020]\\nA three-dimensional rendering of a fractured sintered construct 100 generated as described above is seen in FIG. 2 and includes a matrix 120 of sintered beads of borosilicate glass defining a fracture 130. It will be appreciated that the fracture is approximately 0.5 mm thick_10 mm wide_76 mm long. It will also be appreciated that the sintered beads form a porous structure with pores of different sizes, but generally of an average size of less than 0.05 mm diameter. Thus, it will be appreciated that the fracture constitutes a non-random space defined in the sintered construct 100 where the width and length of the fracture are at least one hundred times larger than the average pore size defined between sintered beads, and the height of the fracture is at least twice the average pore size.\\n[0021]\\nIn one aspect, in forming the fractured sintered construct 100 of FIG. 2 by utilizing the assembly of FIG. 1, and as previously mentioned, the metal sheet 30 is suspended in the tube 10 and surrounded by glass beads 20. The metal sheet 30 may be suspended in tube 10 in any of several manners. By way of example, tube 10 may be partially filled with well-mixed beads 20, and then sheet 30 may be laid over the beads already in the tube. Another manner of suspending the sheet 30 in the tube 10 is to extend the sheet 30 beyond the length of the tube and utilizing a clamp 50 and a stand (not shown) to clamp the sheet 30 in place. Another manner of suspending the sheet 30 in the tube 10 is to attach extremely thin wires to ends of the sheet 30 and run the wires out to a clamp which holds the wires in tension. Other manners of suspending the sheet 30 may be used. With the sheet 30 is suspended in the tube 10, the beads 20 are poured into the surrounding space. Periodic vibration of the tube 10 and sheet 30 as the beads are poured into the surrounding space may aid in forming a random closed packing of the beads 20.\\n[0022]\\nTurning to FIG. 3, a fractured sintered construct 200 is seen which was formed by suspending a metal wire (not shown) having a diameter of approximately 0.1 mm in a tube (e.g., in some cases the diameter of the wire is sub santially smaller that the bead size), and packing glass beads around the wire, sintering the beads as previously discussed with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2, and dissolving the metal wire. The resulting construct 200 includes a sintered matrix 220 defining a channel 230 which has a length that is at least one hundred times larger than the average pore size between the sintered beads, and at least twice the average pore size in width and height.\\n[0023]\\nIn one embodiment, the hollow tube 10 is rectangular in cross-section. The tube may assume any desired size. By way of example only, a tube may be 6 mm_6 mm in cross section or 12 mm_12 mm in cross section, or any other desired useful size, whether smaller or larger. The tube may be square or rectangular in cross section. The tube may also be of a desired length such as 30 mm or 70 mm, or any other desired length. In another embodiment, the hollow tube 10 is circular or oval in cross section.\\n[0024]\\nThe hollow tube 10 may also be made of any of many materials, provided the tube 10 will not melt during the process of sintering the beads and will not react with the solvent that is used to dissolve the metal sheet or wire. In one embodiment the hollow tube 10 is made of quartz. In another embodiment, the hollow tube is made of borosilicate glass. In another embodiment, the hollow tube is made of titanium. In one aspect, a clear (transparent or translucent) material is useful for the hollow tube 10 so that the sintered construct contained in the hollow tube is visible to the human eye when fluid is introduced to the sintered construct.\\n[0025]\\nIn one embodiment, the beads 20 may be made of any of many materials, provided that they can be sintered into a construct mimicking a geological formation, that they will not react with the solvent that is used to dissolve the sheet or wire and that they have a softening temperature below the softening temperature of the hollow tube. In one embodiment where the hollow tube is made from quartz, the beads 20 are made from borosilicate glass. In one embodiment where the hollow tube is made from borosilicate glass, the beads are made from soda-lime glass. In one aspect, it can be useful for the beads 20 to have dimensions of different sizes. Thus, in one embodiment, beads having diameters between 1 micron and 5000 microns are utilized, although it will be appreciated that where a large bead is utilized, numerous small beads are also utilized to ensure that the pore sizes remain small. The percentages of beads having specific diameters may be selected as desired or the selection may be random. In one embodiment, the beads with different diameter sizes are mixed before placement in the hollow tube to ensure a random distribution, and as the beads are introduced into the hollow tube 10, the hollow tube may be shaken with a shaker or by hand to ensure that the beads are well mixed. If desired, the tube 10 and sheet 30 may also be vibrated as the beads are poured in order to aid in a random packing.\\n[0026]\\nIn one embodiment, the sheet 30 or wire may be made of any of many materials provided that they will not melt at the sintering temperature of the hollow beads 20, and provided they can be dissolved without injuring the sintered construct. By way of example and not by way of limitation, the sheet or wire may be made of copper, zinc or tin. The sheet is typically between 100 microns and 2 millimeter thick and is at least one hundred times longer and wider than the average pore size of the sintered construct. Similarly, the wire is typically between 100 microns and one millimeter in diameter and at least one hundred times longer than the average pore size of the sintered construct.\\n[0027]\\nIn one embodiment, a plurality of sheets and/or wires are placed at different locations in the hollow tube 10 and have beads surrounded them prior to sintering. A sheet and a wire may be used together and displaced one from the other. The sheet(s) and/or wire(s) may be displaced from each other in one or more of the three dimensions.\\n[0028]\\nAlthough only a few examples have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the examples without materially departing from this subject disclosure. Thus, by way of example only, and not by way of limitation, while various embodiments describe tubes, beads, and sheets (or wires) of particular materials, other materials may be utilized provided that the tube (and sheets or wires) will not be damaged during sintering of the beads and provided that the sintered beads will not be damaged during dissolving of the sheets or wires. Also, while tubes, beads and sheets of particular sizes are described, other sizes may be utilized, provided that the desired fracture or channel is obtained. Further, while particular temperatures and heating times were described with respect to the sintering process, it will be appreciated that other temperatures and heating times could be utilized. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this disclosure as defined in the following claims. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures.

Accordingly, organizations desire systems and methods that can perform reservoir simulations more efficiently (e.g., using fewer processing resources, in shorter amounts of time, using less memory, etc.).\\nSUMMARY\\n[0004]\\nSystems, apparatus, computer-readable media, and methods are disclosed, of which the methods include obtaining reservoir data; translating the reservoir data into grid properties to create a grid; dividing the grid into domains; generating coarse grids corresponding to each domain; processing the domains, where processing a domain includes: calculating pressure for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, calculating flux for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, and calculating transport of fluids for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain; and generating a reservoir simulation corresponding to the grid based on processing each domain.\\n[0005]\\nIn some embodiments, calculating pressure, flux, and transport of fluids for each domain can represent a single timestep where multiple timesteps are performed.\\n[0006]\\nIn other embodiments, the grid is divided into a number of domains that corresponds to at least one of a number of available computer systems, a number of available processors, and a number of available cores.\\n[0007]\\nIn further embodiments, generating the coarse grids corresponding to each domain can include generating coarse grids of different granularities for each domain.\\n[0008]\\nIn some implementations, processing each domain comprises processing the domains in parallel on at least one of different computer systems, different processors, or different cores.\\n[0009]\\nIn other implementations, processing each domain can include communicating information between the different computer systems, different processors, or different cores during the calculating the pressure, the flux, and the transport of fluids.\\n[0010]\\nIn further implementations, calculating the pressure, the flux, and the transport of fluids for each domain can include spawning threads for processing using multiple cores, the threads can be scheduled for execution on the cores using an operating system scheduler or a threading technology scheduler, and the threads can utilize shared memory of a processor corresponding to the cores.\\n[0011]\\nSystems and apparatus are also disclosed that include a processor and a memory system with non-transitory, computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the systems and apparatus to perform operations that include obtaining reservoir data; translating the reservoir data into grid properties to create a grid; dividing the grid into domains; generating coarse grids corresponding to each domain; processing the domains, where processing a domain includes: calculating pressure for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, calculating flux for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, and calculating transport of fluids for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain; and generating a reservoir simulation corresponding to the grid based on processing each domain.\\n[0012]\\nNon-transitory, computer-readable media are also disclosed that store instructions that, when executed by a processor of a computing system, cause the computing system to perform operations that include obtaining reservoir data; translating the reservoir data into grid properties to create a grid; dividing the grid into domains; generating coarse grids corresponding to each domain; processing the domains, where processing a domain includes: calculating pressure for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, calculating flux for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain, and calculating transport of fluids for the domain using a coarse grid corresponding to the domain; and generating a reservoir simulation corresponding to the grid based on processing each domain.\\n[0013]\\nThe foregoing summary is intended merely to introduce a subset of the aspects of the present disclosure, and is not intended to be exhaustive or in any way identify any particular elements as being more relevant than any others.

Some operations in the processing procedures, methods, techniques, and workflows disclosed herein may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.\\n[0024]\\nFIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system 100 that includes various management components 110 to manage various aspects of a geologic environment 150 (e.g., an environment that includes a sedimentary basin, a reservoir 151, one or more faults 153-1, one or more geobodies 153-2, etc.). For example, the management components 110 may allow for direct or indirect management of sensing, drilling, injecting, extracting, etc., with respect to the geologic environment 150. In turn, further information about the geologic environment 150 may become available as feedback 160 (e.g., optionally as input to one or more of the management components 110).\\n[0025]\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the management components 110 include a seismic data component 112, an additional information component 114 (e.g., well/logging data), a processing component 116, a simulation component 120, an attribute component 130, an analysis/visualization component 142, and a workflow component 144. In operation, seismic data and other information provided per the components 112 and 114 may be input to the simulation component 120.\\n[0026]\\nIn an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may rely on entities 122. Entities 122 may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells, surfaces, bodies, reservoirs, etc. In the system 100, the entities 122 can include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities 122 may include entities based on data acquired via sensing, observation, etc. (e.g., the seismic data 112 and other information 114). An entity may be characterized by one or more properties (e.g., a geometrical pillar grid entity of an earth model may be characterized by a porosity property). Such properties may represent one or more measurements (e.g., acquired data), calculations, etc.\\n[0027]\\nIn an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may operate in conjunction with a software framework such as an object-based framework. In such a framework, entities may include entities based on pre-defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object-based framework is the MICROSOFT¨ .NET¨ framework (Redmond, Wash.), which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET¨ framework, an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use by a program, script, etc. For example, borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data.\\n[0028]\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the simulation component 120 may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component 130, which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component 120 (e.g., consider the processing component 116). As an example, the simulation component 120 may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component 130. In an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may construct one or more models of the geologic environment 150, which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment 150 (e.g., responsive to one or more acts, whether natural or artificial). In the example of FIG. 1, the analysis/visualization component 142 may allow for interaction with a model or model-based results (e.g., simulation results, etc.). As an example, output from the simulation component 120 may be input to one or more other workflows, as indicated by a workflow component 144.\\n[0029]\\nAs an example, the simulation component 120 may include one or more features of a simulator such as the ECLIPSEª reservoir simulator (Schlumberger Limited, Houston Tex.), the INTERSECTª reservoir simulator (Schlumberger Limited, Houston Tex.), etc. As an example, a simulation component, a simulator, etc. may include features to implement one or more meshless techniques (e.g., to solve one or more equations, etc.). As an example, a reservoir or reservoirs may be simulated with respect to one or more enhanced recovery techniques (e.g., consider a thermal process such as SAGD, etc.).\\n[0030]\\nIn an example embodiment, the management components 110 may include features of a commercially available framework such as the PETREL¨ seismic to simulation software framework (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.). The PETREL¨ framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL¨ framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance, for example, by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework, various professionals (e.g., geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers) can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data-driven application (e.g., where data is input for purposes of modeling, simulating, etc.).\\n[0031]\\nIn an example embodiment, various aspects of the management components 110 may include add-ons or plug-ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example, a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN¨ framework environment (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.) allows for integration of add-ons (or plug-ins) into a PETREL¨ framework workflow. The OCEAN¨ framework environment leverages .NET¨ tools (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and offers stable, user-friendly interfaces for efficient development. In an example embodiment, various components may be implemented as add-ons (or plug-ins) that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment (e.g., according to application programming interface (API) specifications, etc.).\\n[0032]\\nFIG. 1 also shows an example of a framework 170 that includes a model simulation layer 180 along with a framework services layer 190, a framework core layer 195 and a modules layer 175. The framework 170 may include the commercially available OCEAN¨ framework where the model simulation layer 180 is the commercially available PETREL¨ model-centric software package that hosts OCEAN¨ framework applications. In an example embodiment, the PETREL¨ software may be considered a data-driven application. The PETREL¨ software can include a framework for model building and visualization.\\n[0033]\\nAs an example, a framework may include features for implementing one or more mesh generation techniques. For example, a framework may include an input component for receipt of information from interpretation of seismic data, one or more attributes based at least in part on seismic data, log data, image data, etc. Such a framework may include a mesh generation component that processes input information, optionally in conjunction with other information, to generate a mesh.\\n[0034]\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the model simulation layer 180 may provide domain objects 182, act as a data source 184, provide for rendering 186 and provide for various user interfaces 188. Rendering 186 may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces 188 may provide a common look and feel for application user interface components.\\n[0035]\\nAs an example, the domain objects 182 can include entity objects, property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells, surfaces, bodies, reservoirs, etc., while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example, an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information (e.g., to display the well as part of a model).\\n[0036]\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, data may be stored in one or more data sources (or data stores, generally physical data storage devices), which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer 180 may be configured to model projects. As such, a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs, models, results and cases. Thus, upon completion of a modeling session, a user may store a project. At a later time, the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer 180, which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.\\n[0037]\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the geologic environment 150 may include layers (e.g., stratification) that include a reservoir 151 and one or more other features such as the fault 153-1, the geobody 153-2, etc. As an example, the geologic environment 150 may be outfitted with any of a variety of sensors, detectors, actuators, etc. For example, equipment 152 may include communication circuitry to receive and to transmit information with respect to one or more networks 155. Such information may include information associated with downhole equipment 154, which may be equipment to acquire information, to assist with resource recovery, etc. Other equipment 156 may be located remote from a well site and include sensing, detecting, emitting or other circuitry. Such equipment may include storage and communication circuitry to store and to communicate data, instructions, etc. As an example, one or more satellites may be provided for purposes of communications, data acquisition, etc. For example, FIG. 1 shows a satellite in communication with the network 155 that may be configured for communications, noting that the satellite may additionally or include circuitry for imagery (e.g., spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric, etc.).\\n[0038]\\nFIG. 1 also shows the geologic environment 150 as optionally including equipment 157 and 158 associated with a well that includes a substantially horizontal portion that may intersect with one or more fractures 159. For example, consider a well in a shale formation that may include natural fractures, artificial fractures (e.g., hydraulic fractures) or a combination of natural and artificial fractures. As an example, a well may be drilled for a reservoir that is laterally extensive. In such an example, lateral variations in properties, stresses, etc. may exist where an assessment of such variations may assist with planning, operations, etc. to develop a laterally extensive reservoir (e.g., via fracturing, injecting, extracting, etc.). As an example, the equipment 157 and/or 158 may include components, a system, systems, etc. for fracturing, seismic sensing, analysis of seismic data, assessment of one or more fractures, etc.\\n[0039]\\nAs mentioned, the system 100 may be used to perform one or more workflows. A workflow may be a process that includes a number of worksteps. A workstep may operate on data, for example, to create new data, to update existing data, etc. As an example, a workstep may operate on one or more inputs and create one or more results, for example, based on one or more algorithms. As an example, a system may include a workflow editor for creation, editing, executing, etc. of a workflow. In such an example, the workflow editor may provide for selection of one or more pre-defined worksteps, one or more customized worksteps, etc. As an example, a workflow may be a workflow implementable in the PETREL¨ software, for example, that operates on seismic data, seismic attribute(s), etc. As an example, a workflow may be a process implementable in the OCEAN¨ framework. As an example, a workflow may include one or more worksteps that access a module such as a plug-in (e.g., external executable code, etc.).\\n[0040]\\nIn reservoir simulation, the desire for increased computational power to simulate the flow dynamics of increasingly large and complex reservoir models generates a steady push to develop new simulation technology. The widespread availability of many-core computers and clusters today makes the scalability of reservoir simulators a differentiating factor. To achieve favorable performance from modern computing hardware where a large number of cores are interconnected in a non-uniform network, parallelism may be built into simulation software at many levels. The message passing interface (MPI) paradigm used to interconnect nodes in a cluster, and/or used within individual nodes, may be combined with other kinds of parallel computing technologies to effectively harness the computing power available in clusters where each computing system may contain tens to hundreds of cores. The advances in hardware demand further advances in computational methods.\\n[0041]\\nCurrent state of the art reservoir simulators are mostly based on a fully implicit formulation of the mass balance equations for the reservoir fluids where large sparse and ill-conditioned linear systems are solved iteratively for each timestep. By applying preconditioners, algebraic multigrid solvers, and a software framework that is designed for parallelism, good parallel performance can be achieved.\\n[0042]\\nEmbodiments of the present disclosure may provide, among other things, a hybrid parallel strategy for a multiscale solver that has been implemented in a reservoir simulator. For the multiscale solver, there are several possibilities for algorithm parallelization because the coarse grid provides independent domains to perform concurrent computations. Also presented herein is a distributed memory parallel implementation of the multiscale solver by using an MPI framework available in the simulator. The hybrid parallel multiscale solver is capable of harnessing the power of modern clusters with many-core computing systems.\\nMultiscale Method\\n[0043]\\nThe simulator framework is based on a fully implicit compositional formulation of the mass balance equations for multiple fluid components distributed in one or more phases. In this framework, an alternative solver engine is implemented that employs a sequential implicit formulation. This solver can be iterated to converge to the same solution as the fully implicit solver, if desired. This numerical formulation enables the use of a multiscale solver for pressure that effectively computes pressure and mass conservative fluxes.\\n[0044]\\nThe application of multiscale methods in reservoir simulation uses the possibility to formulate an elliptic or parabolic pressure equation that enables a sequential update of primary variables at the end of the timestep: first pressure is computed, then, using a multi-phase extension of Darcy' s law, phase fluxes are computed before the fluid composition, i.e., phase saturations and component molar fractions, are updated.\\n[0045]\\nThe sequential pressure equation yields a set of discrete nonlinear equations that are solved to obtain the reservoir pressure pn+1 at the end of a timestep. For brevity, the nonlinear equations can be written as\\n\\n(p n+1)=0. __(1)\\n[0046]\\nTo solve these equations, linearize the above nonlinear equation (1), set p1=pn and use a Newton-Raphson iteration.\\n\\np v+1 =p v J v 1(p v), v=1, __(2)\\nto reduce the norm of the pressure residual _F(pv+1)_ to a sufficiently small value. This may demand repeated large, sparse, and possibly ill-conditioned linear systems, and this could be where much of the run time is spent in a reservoir simulator. To solve this efficiently, an algebraic multiscale solver can be used that computes fit for purpose prolongation operators P that are used to map between the pressures in the simulation grid and degrees of freedom xc at a coarser scale. The coarse scale can be defined by a partitioning of the cells into non-overlapping simply connected subdomains called coarse blocks. Each column in P (called a basis function) is associated with one coarse block and has compact support. The basis functions approximate the solution of a homogeneous problem for the pressure Jacobian Jv in the vicinity of the coarse blocks, i.e., Jv_iÅ0.\\n[0047]\\nTogether, the basis functions form a discrete partition of unity and are used to approximate the pressure pv+1=Px. Each linear system Jv (pv+1 pv)=Fp(pv) can then be approximated at a coarse level by\\n\\nRJvPxc=(pv), __(3)\\nwhere R is a restriction operator that can either be a PT or a finite-volume restriction operator that sums equations associated with each coarse block. The coarse linear system Eq. (3) is smaller and easier to solve than Eq. (2). The multiscale pressure update Pxc can approximate the global characteristics of the solution such as the combined effect of injection and production wells, aquifers, barriers to flow, and highly permeable regions, etc. To obtain an accurate solution of Eq. (2), the multiscale approximation is combined with an efficient smoother, e.g., ILU(0), that reduces the local high frequency errors.\\n[0048]\\nAfter reservoir pressure has been computed, fluxes are computed. This can be achieved by a direct application of the multiphase extension of Darcy' s law, or by solving local boundary value problems for each coarse block, with boundary conditions defined by fine grid phase fluxes computed from the reservoir pressure. The latter approach will, under certain conditions, give mass conservative fluxes.\\n[0049]\\nThen, the saturations and molar fractions are computed at the end of the timestep by solving nc 1 component conservation equations (where nc is the number of components), with phase fluxes written in terms of total flux. The conservation equations are linearized and each linear system is solved approximately by a non-overlapping Schwarz method with a direct method as a subdomain solver. This enables parallel execution of the domains.\\nHybrid Parallel Strategy\\n[0050]\\nThe hybrid parallelization strategy can use both a message-passing system for parallel computing (e.g., MPI) and multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing (e.g., using the OpenMP application programming interface (API)). Message-passing processes are employed for domain decomposition over distributed memory systems, and within each domain shared memory threads are used for concurrent calculations.\\n[0051]\\nUsing a message-passing system for parallel computing, data can be decomposed into smaller parts (i.e., domains) and processes can be run independently and concurrently on different cores, processors, and/or computer systems. This is not just advantageous in terms of speed gain, but also minimizes memory requirements of individual machines. This can be used for solving large data sets which are otherwise prohibitively slow and resource expensive on single devices.\\n[0052]\\nThe parallel implementation of the sequential implicit multiscale algorithm uses a distributed parallel simulator framework that is based on domain decomposition. This framework enables parallel initialization, property computation and flash calculation, communication of primary variables between processes, and also a parallel library for linear algebra and linear solvers. A benefit of working in this reservoir simulator is that many of these parallel capabilities are available and automatically enabled.\\n[0053]\\nTo parallelize the sequential implicit multiscale solver, the serial implementation can be extended. The boundaries of coarse grids used by the multiscale algorithm can configured to coincide with the boundaries of domains.\\n[0054]\\nThen, the multiscale algorithm can be formulated in terms of linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products. This allows a working solver to be quickly achieved that leverages the existing parallel linear algebra framework to handle communications between processes in an efficient manner.\\n[0055]\\nIn order to favorably use both parallel technologies, shared memory threads are spawned within each process in the hybrid approach.\\n[0056]\\nMajor and time consuming components of computation in the simulation engine are divided into pressure, flux, and transport routines. The components can include methods of handling the assembly and further solving of linear systems, various computations, and updates of properties and solutions. Shared memory parallelization can be applied to these methods. The accumulation term is assembled over the fine cells within a domain, whereas flux term assembly is over the coarse cells. The linear solvers in the flux and transport parts can be direct solvers that operate on independent matrices over each coarse cell. The construction of pressure and transport matrices and corresponding right hand sides, as part of the compute preceding the direct solver step, is over the connections between the cells. Depending on the method, work with varying grain size is concurrently executed by multiple threads. There are several other less major methods involved in calculation of norms, residuals, checking convergence criteria, and well matrix calculations, etc., which are also parallelized over various levels of granularity. Programming effort is reduced by taking advantage of a variety of available independent loops.\\n[0057]\\nThus, shared memory parallelism provides advantages, such as automatic handling of threads, low overhead of parallelization, ease of usage, etc.\\n[0058]\\nFIG. 2 illustrates an example of a method for performing a parallel multiscale reservoir simulation, according to an embodiment. In some embodiments, the example method illustrated in FIG. 2 can be performed using a computing device that includes the framework (e.g., framework 170) and the management components (e.g., management components 110) described above with reference to FIG. 1.\\n[0059]\\nThe example method can begin in 200, when the computing device obtains data representing a geographical area (e.g., metrics of a subterranean formation, such as a reservoir) that is being simulated. The data may include measured properties of a reservoir determined using, for example, core samples, seismic analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, gamma ray logging, any other type of well logging, etc. Such properties can be collected using various devices, such as well-logging tools, logging-while-drilling devices, seismic receivers (e.g., geophones), imaging devices, and the like. Measured properties can include, for example, rock type, porosity, permeability, pore volume, volumetric flow rates, well pressure, gas/oil ratio, composition of fluid in the reservoir, etc.\\n[0060]\\nIn 210, the computing device can translate the obtained metrics into grid properties for a grid that represents the geographical area. For example, the metrics can include oil volumes, water volumes, gas volumes, etc., associated with geological formations. Based on the associated geological coordinates, the volumes can be assigned as grid properties of specific grid segments within the grid.

In downhole wellbore operations, current technologies require some sort of surface intervention to activate the actuator. Examples of surface intervention primarily include manipulation of the well string and applying hydraulic pressure through the well string to the actuator. In at least one disconnect device, a hot fluid such as steam or a corrosive agent is utilized to melt a retaining member thereby releasing the interconnected elements.\\n[0003]\\nIt is a desire to provide a substantially self-contained actuator for downhole operation that does not require surface intervention for actuation. It is a still further desire to provide an actuation device that is actuated by the ambient conditions of the environment in which the actuator is positioned. It is a still further desire to provide an actuator that is actuated by expansion or contraction of a material in response to the surrounding environmental temperature.\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\n[0004]\\nAccordingly, thermally actuated actuators and methods are provided. In one embodiment, an actuator assembly includes a first portion, a second portion, means for releasably locking the first portion and the second portion in a locked position interconnecting the first and second portions, and an expandable material in operational connection with the locking means, the expandable material expanding in response to exposure to a selected temperature activating the locking means to an unlocked position disengaging the first portion from the second portion.\\n[0005]\\nAn embodiment of a system for disconnecting a first element from a second element at a desired position in a wellbore includes a disconnect tool containing an expandable material, the disconnect tool being actuatable from a locked position, wherein the first and the second elements are interconnected, to an unlocked position, wherein the first and the second element are disconnected, upon a determined expansion of the expandable material in response to a temperature at the desired position.\\n[0006]\\nAn embodiment of a method for disconnecting a first element from a second element at a desired location in a wellbore includes the steps of: providing a disconnect tool having first portion, a second portion, and containing an expandable material, the disconnect tool having a locked position interconnecting the first and second portions and an unlocked position disconnecting the first and second portions; making up the disconnect tool in the locked position; connecting the first element to the first portion and the second element to the second portion; positioning the disconnect tool at the desired location in the well; and activating the disconnect tool to the unlocked position upon a determined expansion of the expandable material in response to exposure of the disconnect tool to a temperature at the desired location in the wellbore.\\n[0007]\\nThe foregoing has outlined the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n[0008]\\nThe foregoing and other features and aspects of the present invention will be best understood with reference to the following detailed description of a specific embodiment of the invention, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:\\n[0009]\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic of a wellbore utilizing an embodiment of the thermal actuator of the present invention as a disconnect device;\\n[0010]\\nFIG. 2 is a schematic of an embodiment of the thermal actuator in a locked position;\\n[0011]\\nFIG. 3 is a schematic of an embodiment of the thermal actuator in the unlocked position; and\\n[0012]\\nFIG. 4 is a schematic of an embodiment of the thermal actuator illustrating the disconnection of the first element from the second element.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\\n[0013]\\nRefer now to the drawings wherein depicted elements are not necessarily shown to scale and wherein like or similar elements are designated by the same reference numeral through the several views.\\n[0014]\\nAs used herein, the terms ÒupÓ and ÒdownÓ; ÒupperÓ and ÒlowerÓ; and other like terms indicating relative positions to a given point or element are utilized to more clearly describe some elements of the embodiments of the invention. Commonly, these terms relate to a reference point as the surface from which drilling operations are initiated as being the top point and the total depth of the well being the lowest point.\\n[0015]\\nThe present disclosure teaches an actuation device and method that may utilize the temperature of the environment in which the device is positioned for actuation. The present invention is described herein in relation to an embodiment as a disconnect device for use downhole in wellbore operations. However, it is recognized that the device and method may be utilized in various operations and processes, such as for shifting valve members, energizing seals and the like.\\n[0016]\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic of a wellbore wherein an embodiment of a thermal actuator 10 is utilized as a disconnect device. Wellbore 12 is drilled from the ground surface 14 into a subterranean formation 16. Thermal actuator 10 interconnects a first element 18 and a second element 20 for running the elements in combination into wellbore 12. Upon positioning of actuator 10 and elements 18, 20 in the desired position in wellbore 12, actuator 10 is activated disconnecting elements 18 and 20.\\n[0017]\\nIn the illustrated embodiment, first element 18 is coiled tubing and second element 20 is a tubing string. Tubing string 20 is a primary tubing string and is utilized to run coil tubing string 18 into position without being damaged. Once coiled tubing 18 is positioned, the heat from formation 16 causes actuator 10 to actuate to a release position, disengaging coiled tubing 18 from tubing string 20. Coiled tubing 18 may then be removed from wellbore 12 leaving tubing string 20 in place for further operations, or left in position free from connection with primary tubing string 20.\\n[0018]\\nReferring now to FIG. 2, an embodiment of thermal actuator 10 is shown in the locked position. Thermal actuator includes a first portion 22 releasably connectable with a second portion 24, a piston 26 and a thermally activated expandable material 28.\\n[0019]\\nFirst portion 22 is cylindrical body having a connection end 30, an opposing neck 32, and an internal chamber 34. Neck 32 forms an opening into chamber 34, and is sized to receive a portion of piston 26. A collet 36, having an arm and an expanded portion or finger 38, extends substantially axially from neck 32.\\n[0020]\\nConnection end 30 is illustrated as a threaded connection for connecting with coiled tubing 18 (FIG. 1). Other means of connection, such as welding or the like may be provided at connection end 30.\\n[0021]\\nSecond portion 24 includes a generally tubular housing forming a cavity 50 adapted to receive neck 32 and piston 26. The internal surface 42 of second portion 24 is profiled to include at least one recessed portion 44 for holding expanded region 38 of collet 36 when actuator 10 is in the first or locked position. Piston 26 includes an external, stepped platform 46 having a raised portion for maintaining expanded region 38 in recess 44 when actuator 10 is in the locked position. Piston 26 may further include an expanded diameter end 52.\\n[0022]\\nWhen in the locked position, first portion 22 and piston 26 are held in connection with one another by mechanism 48, generally described as a shear mechanism. Shear mechanism 48 may include any shear, fracture, frangible, or rupture type device such as pins, screws, discs, or other device that releases the connection upon exertion of determined force.\\n[0023]\\nPiston 36, expanded region 38, and recess 44, work in combination as a releasable locking mechanism 60. Locking mechanism 60 interconnects first and second portions in a fixed position relative to each other in the locked position to prevent the accidental or premature disconnection of first and second portions when running the tool into the wellbore. Thermally activated expandable material 28 is in operational connection with locking mechanism 60. Upon a determined expansion of material 28, locking mechanism 60 is activated to the unlocked position as shown in FIG. 3.\\n[0024]\\nSecond portion 24 also includes a connection end 40 adapted for connection with tubing string 20 (FIG. 1). For the illustrated and described embodiments, connection end 40 is a sub adapted for welding to the tubing string. However, it should be recognized that connection end 40 may include other engagement means, such as threading, corresponding to the desired application.\\n[0025]\\nThermally activated expandable material 28 provides the motivating or actuating energy for moving locking mechanism 60 to the unlocked position. Material 28 may include any material (fluid, solid, or gas) that expands in response to thermal energy. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of material 28 must be such that the material will expand in response to the temperature differential between surface 14 (FIG. 1) and at the desired depth in formation 16. Although, heat may be supplied by an operator for actuation of disconnect device 10, it is often desirable for activation to occur upon exposure to the ambient temperature at the desired location within formation 16. Examples of expandable material 28 include hydraulic oils, which are readily available for most applications, solids and gasses. Suitable hydraulic oils are provided by numerous manufactures, such as a hydraulic oil provided by Shell under the name TELLUS 32. Selection of material 28, the volume of chamber 34, and the range of movement of piston 26 may be adjusted to meet the temperature differential between the surface and the desired actuation position.\\n[0026]\\nThe make-up of thermal actuator 10 in the locked, or run-in, position is now described. Piston 26 is positioned with expanded end 52 disposed within cavity 50. End 52 is located a distance form the back wall 54 of cavity 50 leaving a void 56. External platform 46 of piston 26 urges and holds expanded region 38 of collet 36 within recess portion 44 of internal surface 42. A retainer mechanism 58, such as a snap spring, may be positioned from second portion 24 to engage expanded end 52 of piston 26. First element 18 is connected to first portion 22 and second element 20 is connected to second portion 24. Thermally activated expandable material 28 is disposed in chamber 34 so as to substantially fill the volume of chamber 34 to piston 26. For purposes of this example, 0.25 liters of hydraulic oil is filled in chamber 34 up to piston 26. The surface, or run-in, temperature is 20 degrees Celsius. The anticipated temperature at the desired actuation point is approximately 100 degrees Celsius, and at which point the hydraulic oil will expand to a volume of approximately 0.267 liters.\\n[0027]\\nOperation of thermal actuator 10 is now described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4. Thermal actuator 10 is made-up in the locked position interconnecting first element 18 and second element 20. Elements 18, 20 and actuator 10 are run-in to wellbore 12 to the desired depth and position.\\n[0028]\\nExposure of actuator 10, and more specifically expandable material 28 to the increased temperature in formation 16 relative to surface 14 causes material 28 to expand. Expansion of material 28 urges piston 26 axially away from first portion 22 and chamber 34. Shear mechanism 48 maintains piston 26 in a fixed position with first portion 22 maintaining a substantially constant volume of chamber 34. The pressure generated by the expansion of material 28 acts on area 61 of piston 26 exerting a force on shear mechanism 48. The pressure in chamber 34 increases until the capacity of shear mechanism 48 is exceeded, releasing the connection between first portion 22 and piston 26. The pressure from expansion of material 28 then moves piston 36 axially. As piston 26 moves, expanded region 38 of collet 36 moves radially inward against the decreasing diameter of external platform 46, releasing region 38 from engagement with recess portion 44 and second portion 24. FIG. 3 illustrates actuator 10 in the unlocked position. With locking mechanism 60 unlocked, first portion 22 is disengaged from second portion 24.\\n[0029]\\nAs shown in FIG. 4, retaining mechanism 58 moves radially inward against piston 26 as end 42 moves toward and the back wall of cavity 50. This position of retaining mechanism 58 forms a restriction within cavity 50 around piston 26. The restriction maintains piston 26 in connection with second portion 24, thus preventing piston 26 from releasing into the wellbore and from re-engaging locking mechanism 60 in the locked position. FIG. 4 illustrated the separation of first portion 22 and second portion 24 upon applying an upward force to first portion 22.\\n[0030]\\nFrom the foregoing detailed description of specific embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent that a thermal actuator that is novel has been disclosed.

Generally, a completion assembly is positioned in a wellbore and a service tool is used in cooperation with the completion assembly to create a gravel pack in the annulus around the completion assembly. The gravel pack helps filter out sand and other particulates from a desired production fluid entering the wellbore.\\n[0002]\\nThe gravel pack is formed by flowing a gravel slurry downhole to the well zone to be treated. At the well zone, a carrier fluid is separated from the gravel slurry leaving gravel to form the gravel pack. The carrier fluid reenters the completion assembly through a screen and is returned upwardly through a washpipe section of the service tool. The return flow is directed upwardly through a central passage of the washpipe and then diverted outwardly to an annular flow path through a crossover port. Because of this construction, the length of the wash pipe is generally similar to the length of the well zone to be treated.\\nSUMMARY\\n[0003]\\nIn general, the present invention provides a system and method for forming a gravel pack at one or more well zones along a wellbore. A completion assembly having a completion assembly central bore is positioned in a wellbore. A return is located radially outward of the completion assembly central bore and comprises a flow passage for returning a carrier fluid. Thus, the carrier fluid that is separated from gravel slurry during the gravel packing operation is returned along a flow path external to the completion assembly central bore at the well zone undergoing the gravel packing operation.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n[0004]\\nCertain embodiments of the invention will hereafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements, and:\\n[0005]\\nFIG. 1 is a front elevation view of a completion assembly and service tool deployed in a wellbore, according to an embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0006]\\nFIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of a service tool in a wash-down configuration, according to an embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0007]\\nFIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of the service tool of FIG. 2 in a well treating configuration, according to an embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0008]\\nFIG. 4 is an illustration of a completion assembly and service tool deployed in a wellbore, according to an embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0009]\\nFIG. 5 is an illustration similar to that of FIG. 4 in which the service tool has been shifted to a reversing configuration, according to an embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0010]\\nFIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the completion assembly and service tool deployed in a wellbore, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0011]\\nFIG. 7 is an illustration similar to that of FIG. 6 in which the service tool has been shifted to a reversing configuration, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0012]\\nFIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the completion assembly and service tool deployed in a wellbore, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0013]\\nFIG. 9 is an illustration similar to that of FIG. 8 in which the service tool has been shifted to a reversing configuration, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention;\\n[0014]\\nFIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the completion assembly and service tool deployed in a wellbore, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention; and\\n[0015]\\nFIG. 11 is an illustration similar to that of FIG. 10 in which the service tool has been shifted to a reversing configuration, according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\\n[0016]\\nIn the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.\\n[0017]\\nThe present invention generally relates to a well system that can be used for well treatment operations, such as sand control operations. The system and methodology provide a technique for forming a gravel pack at one or more well zones along a wellbore. A completion assembly is positioned in a wellbore and is constructed to provide return flow from the gravel packing operation external to a completion assembly central bore. As gravel is deposited in the desired well zone, the carrier fluid or return fluid is routed back to the surface through a return. However, the return is positioned so the flow of returning fluid is along a flow path that remains radially outward of the completion assembly central bore.\\n[0018]\\nReferring generally to FIG. 1, one embodiment of a well system 30 is illustrated. In this embodiment, well system 30 comprises a completion assembly 32 and a service string 34 deployed in a wellbore 36. The wellbore 36 is drilled into a subsurface formation 38 having one or more well zones 40 that may contain desirable production fluids, such as petroleum. In the example illustrated, wellbore 36 is lined with a casing 42. The casing 42 typically is perforated in a manner that places perforations 44 along each well zone 40. The perforations 44 enable flow of fluids into (or out of) wellbore 36 at each well zone 40. Although the present completion assembly and service tool can be used in single zone applications, it is also amenable to use in well treatment, e.g. gravel packing, operations at multiple zones, as illustrated in FIG. 1.\\n[0019]\\nIn the embodiment illustrated, completion assembly 32 comprises a continuous internal passage referred to as a completion assembly central bore 45 defined within, for example, a tubular structure 46. Tubular structure 46 comprises screens 48 positioned at each well zone 40 to allow fluid flow therethrough. For example, screens 48 may allow the inward flow of returning carrier fluid that flows from the annulus surrounding the completion assembly 32 into the region between tubular structure 46 and service string 34 at the subject treatment zone. A packer 50, such as a GP packer, secures completion assembly 32 to wellbore casing 42. Additionally, a plurality of isolation packers 52 are positioned between completion assembly 32 and the surrounding casing 42 at predetermined locations to selectively isolate the well zones 40.\\n[0020]\\nService string 34 may be deployed downhole with completion assembly 32 on an appropriate conveyance 54, such as a tubing. The service string 34 may be attached to completion assembly 32 proximate the upper packer 50. Generally, service string 34 comprises an upper section 56 coupled to a service tool 58 through a crossover 60. Crossover 60 comprises one or more crossover exit ports 62 that are positioned adjacent corresponding circulating ports of completion assembly 32 to enable the flow of treatment fluid into the annulus surrounding completion assembly 32. In a gravel packing operation, a gravel slurry is pumped down into this annulus at a given well zone, and the carrier or return fluid portion of the slurry is returned up through service string 34. In the present design, this returning fluid does not enter the interior of the service tool washpipe.\\n[0021]\\nDuring run-in, the service tool 58 may be maintained in a wash-down configuration that allows downward fluid flow through the service string and through an internal passage 64, as illustrated in FIG. 2. (It should be noted that other embodiments may use a solid service tool 58 or at least one in which the passage 64 does not extend through the service tool section of service string 34.) Once the wash-down is completed and service string 34 is positioned with completion assembly 32 within the wellbore, further flow of fluid down through passage 64 of the washpipe is blocked, as illustrated in FIG. 3. By way of example, a ball 66 can be dropped onto a corresponding restriction 68, e.g. a shiftable ball seat, to block further downward flow through passage 64. However, a variety of other blocking mechanisms, e.g. valves, can be used to prevent this downward flow. Upon blocking downward flow through passage 64 of service tool 58, a gravel slurry can be diverted radially outward through crossover exit ports 62, as indicated by arrows 70, to the desired well zone being treated.\\n[0022]\\nReferring generally to FIG. 4, an embodiment of well system 30 is illustrated in greater detail as positioned within wellbore 36. In this embodiment, a stripper 72 is deployed between completion assembly 32 and service string 34 to prevent fluid flow into an upper zone. The embodiment further comprises a return 74 through which returning carrier fluid flows along a flow path 76 defined by the return 74. The flow path 76 is radially offset from completion assembly central bore 45 at the subject well zone 40. By way of example, return 74 may be formed from one or more shunt tubes 78.\\n[0023]\\nAs illustrated, gravel slurry is flowed downwardly through service string 34 until it is directed radially outward through crossover ports 62 and corresponding circulating ports 80 of completion assembly 32. The gravel slurry moves outward into the surrounding annulus where gravel is deposited and dehydrated in the desired well zone 40. The separated carrier fluid moves radially inward through the screen or screens 48 positioned in the well zone being treated and then is directed to flow path 76 of return 74. In the embodiment illustrated, the returning fluid is directed radially outward to the flow path 76 which is located at an offset position relative to completion assembly central bore 45 and service tool 58. This access to flow path 76 can be selectively controlled via valves 82. For example, the lowermost valve 82 is opened to permit outflow of returning fluid to flow path 76 in the well zone 40 being treated. Valves 82 can be simple on-off valves, such as sliding sleeve valves, or other suitable valves.\\n[0024]\\nIsolation valves 84 also can be deployed along return 74, e.g. along shunt tubes 78, to enable sections of flow path 76 to be blocked. The valves 84 are used, for example, to shut off access to sections of the shunt tubes 78 that are not being treated. In the illustrated example, the lowermost isolation valve 84 is in a closed position to block any downward flow of return fluids relative to the well zone 40 being treated. A variety of valve types can be used to form isolation valves 84, e.g. ball valves, sliding sleeve valves, and other suitable valves that allow the selective blocking and opening of flow path 76 to isolate sections of the return.\\n[0025]\\nUpon completion of a gravel pack 86 in the desired well zone 40, service string 34 is shifted to a reversing position, as illustrated in FIG. 5. This allows the establishment of a reverse flow of fluid to remove remaining slurry from the service tool before moving the service tool to the next well zone to be treated. In the illustrated embodiment, the service tool is shifted by pulling the service tool upwardly until crossover 60 is moved into cooperation with the valve 82 directly above the well zone in which gravel pack 86 was formed. The valve 82 proximate crossover 60 is opened and the isolation valve 84 directly below is actuated to a closed position, as illustrated in FIG. 5. At this stage, reversing fluid can be flowed downwardly along return 74 and directed into service string 34 through the cooperating valve 82 and crossover 60. The reversing fluid flushes remaining material upwardly and out of the service string 34 to prepare the service tool for use in the next well zone.\\n[0026]\\nPlacement of the returning carrier fluid flow path 76 to the exterior of completion assembly central bore 45 relieves the need for screen isolation. Furthermore, because return flows are directed along the exterior flow path, there is no need to maintain washpipe return spacing that must correspond with well zone length. The various well zones being treated may be of dissimilar lengths, because the relationship of the washpipe to the well zone length is decoupled. Also, because return flows are not directed through the washpipe, there is no need for a corresponding crossover port. This lack of a corresponding crossover port greatly simplifies the design and operation of service tool 58. The well system 30 also offers the ability to wash-down when deploying the apparatus inside wellbore 36, as illustrated in FIG. 2.\\n[0027]\\nThe well system 30 can be used for a variety of applications and in many types of environments. For example, well system 30 can be used with single zone wells or multiple zone wells. Accordingly, the following description is one application of well system 30. However, it should be understood that well system 30 can be used in a variety of other environments, other applications, in cased or open wellbores, and with other or alternate procedures.\\n[0028]\\nBy way of example, well system 30 can be used in a sequential multizone operation in a cased wellbore. In this example, a perforation assembly is initially run-in-hole and well zones 40 are perforated to form perforations 44. Completion assembly 32 is then run-in-hole along with service string 34. Generally, the service string 34 is connected to the completion assembly 32 at the upper packer 50. The completion assembly 32 is then moved to the desired location in wellbore 36.\\n[0029]\\nOnce the completion assembly 32 is placed on depth, ball 66 or other blanking device is dropped from the surface, and service string 34 becomes pressure competent. Pressure may then be applied to the service string 34 to set packer 50 which secures completion assembly 32 to wellbore casing 42. The isolation packers 52 may then be set. By way of example, isolation packers 52 may be set by adjusting service string 34 to a packer setting position and applying tubing pressure within the service string. Then, the service string 34 is placed in a circulating position with exit port 62 positioned adjacent circulating port 80 of completion assembly 32. Simultaneously, the valve 82 is shifted to open the return port at the lower end of the zone to be treated. The valve may be shifted to the open position by the movement of service string 34.\\n[0030]\\nA gravel slurry is circulated into well zone 40 through the circulating port or ports 80, and gravel is placed in the well zone. The gravel is dehydrated from the bottom up such that clear return fluid passes through the outside diameter of the appropriate well screen 48. The returning carrier fluid flows into the annulus between the well screen and the service tool 58. From there, the carrier fluid is directed outwardly into return 74 and then directed upwardly until it exits into the wellbore annulus above stripper 72.\\n[0031]\\nWhen screenout is achieved, service string 34 is moved to the reverse position, and the appropriate isolation valve 84 is closed (see, for example, FIG. 5). The return port just above the closed isolation valve is opened via the corresponding valve 82. Pressure is then applied in the wellbore annulus to force slurry remaining in service string 34 uphole to a surface location. The reversing fluid flows downwardly through return 74 and into the interior of service string 34, as illustrated by the arrows in FIG. 5. Upon completion of the reversing operation, service tool 58 can be moved, e.g. moved uphole, to the next well zone where the servicing operation can be repeated.\\n[0032]\\nAn alternate embodiment of well system 30 is illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7. In this embodiment, in-line valves, such as in-line valves 84 illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, can be eliminated. Instead, one or more check valves 88 are used to enable outflow of returning carrier fluid from beneath well screen 48 to the flow path 76 of return 74, e.g. shunt tubes 78. The check valves 88 automatically block any back flow of fluid from return 74 into the annular area surrounding service tool 58. During a gravel packing operation, gravel slurry flows downwardly through service string 34 until it exits at crossover 60. As the gravel slurry is dehydrated, carrier fluid moves inwardly through screens 48 until it is directed to return 74 through the one or more check valves 88, as indicated by arrows 90 in FIG. 6.\\n[0033]\\nIn this embodiment, an additional valve 92 is located in the completion assembly at each well zone 40 and is used when the service string is positioned in the reversing configuration. Valve 92 may be an on-off valve, such as a sliding sleeve valve or other suitable valve. When the gravel pack is formed in the desired well zone 40, service string 34 is shifted to the reversing configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 7. The shifting of service string 34 can be used to shift valve 92 to an open position which allows reversing fluid to be flowed downwardly through return 74 and into service string 34 via crossover 60, as indicated by arrows 92 in FIG. 7.\\n[0034]\\nReferring generally to FIGS. 8 and 9, another embodiment of well system 30 is illustrated. In this embodiment, the return 74 is localized for each well zone treated. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the completion assembly 32 comprises one or more screen assemblies 48 in each well zone 40, and each screen 40 comprises a solid base pipe 94 surrounded by a screen jacket 96. During a gravel packing operation, the returning carrier fluid flows inwardly through screen jacket 96 into the region between screen jacket 96 and solid screen base pipe 94. Accordingly, return 74 extends into the region between base pipe 94 and screen jacket 96 and has an intake or entry point for returning carrier fluid toward the bottom of the screen. By way of example, a shunt tube 78 can be positioned to extend into the region between screen jacket 96 and base pipe 94 to provide flow path 76 for returning carrier fluid.\\n[0035]\\nIn the embodiment illustrated, a plurality of screen assemblies 48, e.g. two screens 48, are connected by a jumper tube 98 that allows carrier fluid to flow from the region between screen jacket 96 and base pipe 94 of one screen 48 to the region between screen jacket 96 and base pipe 94 of the next adjacent screen 48. Thus, return 74 can extend to the bottom of the lower screen 48 and still function to return carrier fluid entering any and all of the screen assemblies 48. It should be noted that return 74 can be routed to the bottom of the lowermost screen 48 internally or externally of one or more of the screen jackets 96.\\n[0036]\\nIn this embodiment, a valve 100, such as a sliding sleeve, is used to selectively open or block flow from return 74 into an annular region between service string 34 and completion assembly 32. When the service tool 58 is moved to a reversing configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 9, valve 100 is closed. Reversing fluid is circulated down through the annular region between service string 34 and completion assembly 32 and into the interior of service string 34 via crossover ports 62, as illustrated by arrows 102 in FIG. 9. With this embodiment, there is no need for a stripper inside the top packer, because each screen 48 is isolated at its inside diameter by the base pipe 94. Furthermore, this simplified well system has applications in both single zone and multiple zone wellbores.\\n[0037]\\nReferring generally to FIGS. 10 and 11, another embodiment of well system 30 is illustrated. This embodiment is similar to that illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 with a plurality of screens 48 deployed in the well zone. Each screen 48 similarly comprises solid base pipe 94 and surrounding screen jacket 96. However, instead of connecting adjacent screens 48 with jumper tube 98, a separate conduit, e.g. a separate shunt tube 78, is routed to each separate screen 48 for removal of the returning carrier fluid, as illustrated in FIG. 10. Each separate shunt tube 78 has an intake or entry point positioned toward the bottom of the region between the solid base pipe and surrounding screen jacket. The returning fluid entering each screen assembly 48 is routed upward through its dedicated shunt tube and through a valve 100 into the annular region between service string 34 and completion assembly 32.\\n[0038]\\nUpon completion of the gravel packing operation, the service tool 58 is shifted to a reversing configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 11. The valve 100 is shifted to a closed position, and reversing fluid is circulated down through the annular region between service string 34 and completion assembly 32. The reversing fluid flows into the interior of service string 34 via crossover ports 62, as illustrated by arrows 102 in FIG. 11, and the service string is flushed in preparation for servicing the next well or the next well zone in a multizone well. With this embodiment, there again is no need for a stripper inside the top packer, because each screen 48 is isolated at its inside diameter by the base pipe 94. Furthermore, this embodiment also has applications in both single zone and multiple zone wellbores.\\n[0039]\\nWhen well system 30 is used in cased wellbore applications, a perforating assembly may be attached to the bottom of completion assembly 32. The casing 42 can then be perforated at the time completion assembly 32 is run downhole, and a separate perforating trip is eliminated. This approach also can minimize fluid losses because the well zones are treated directly after perforating which may avoid the need for loss control pills. However, well system 30 also can be used in open hole applications were no perforating operation is performed.\\n[0040]\\nThe embodiments described above provide examples of gravel packing well systems that maintain flow of returning carrier fluid radially outside of the completion assembly central bore in the desired well zone region. Depending on a given gravel packing operation, the configuration of the completion assembly and service string can be changed according to requirements of the job. Other components can be added, removed or interchanged to facilitate the treatment operation. For example, a variety of valves can be used, and a variety of return structures can be routed along various paths offset from the internal passage of the service tool. Additionally, the various embodiments described herein can be adapted for use in single zone or multizone applications in cased or open wellbores. The completion assembly central bore comprises a passage that may be formed in a variety of ways with a variety of configurations, orientations, and relative positions within the completion assembly.\\n[0041]\\nAccordingly, although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this invention.

Hydraulic fracturing may be used to create cracks in subsurface formations to allow oil and/or gas to move toward the well. The formation is fractured by introducing a specially engineered fluid, sometimes referred to as fracturing fluid or fracturing slurry, at high pressure and high flow rates into the formation through one or more wellbores. The fracturing fluids may be loaded with proppant which are sized particles that may be mixed with the liquids of the fracturing fluid to help form an efficient conduit for production of hydrocarbons from the formation to the wellbore. Proppant may comprise naturally occurring sand grains or gravel, man-made proppants, e.g. fibers or resin coated sand, high-strength ceramic materials, e.g. sintered bauxite, or other suitable materials. The proppant collects heterogeneously or homogeneously inside the fractures to prop open the fractures formed in the formation. Effectively, the proppant creates planes of permeable conduits through which production fluids can flow to the wellbore.\\n[0004]\\nAt the well site, proppant and other fracturing fluid components are blended at a low-pressure side of the system. The oilfield materials often are delivered from storage facilities to a blender by pneumatic systems which blow the oilfield materials. Water-based liquid is added and the resulting fracturing fluid is delivered downhole under high pressure. However, handling of the proppant prior to blending tends to create substantial dust as the proppant is moved to the blender via blowers. As a result, dust control devices, e.g. vacuums, are employed in an effort to control the dust. The variety of equipment used in the process also tends to create a large footprint at the well site, and operating the equipment is generally a manually intensive process.\\n[0005]\\nTherefore, there is a need for equipment useful at a well site which minimizes the requisite space while utilized, such need met, at least in part, by the following disclosure.\\nSUMMARY\\n[0006]\\nIn some aspects, the disclosure provides systems and methods which facilitate the handling of oilfield materials in a space efficient manner.

For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by anyone of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).\\n[0037]\\nIn addition, use of the ÒaÓ or ÒanÓ are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the inventive concept. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless otherwise stated.\\n[0038]\\nThe terminology and phraseology used herein is for descriptive purposes and should not be construed as limiting in scope. Language such as Òincluding,Ó Òcomprising,Ó Òhaving,Ó Òcontaining,Ó or Òinvolving,Ó and variations thereof, is intended to be broad and encompass the subject matter listed thereafter, equivalents, and additional subject matter not recited.\\n[0039]\\nAlso, as used herein any references to Òone embodimentÓ or Òan embodimentÓ means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase Òin one embodimentÓ in various places in the specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment.\\n[0040]\\nReferring generally to FIGS. 1-2, illustrated therein is one embodiment of a mobile oilfield material transfer unit 450 constructed in accordance with the disclosure. The mobile oilfield material transfer unit 450 may include a chassis 452, a horizontal conveyor system 454 that may be referred to herein as a Òsecond conveyor system 454Ó, an erecting mast assembly 456, and a first conveyor assembly 458, that may also be referred to herein as a vertical conveyor system.\\n[0041]\\nThe chassis 452 includes a support base 460 and a gooseneck portion 462. The chassis 452 may be configured to support the first conveyor assembly 458 and to be pulled by a truck 36 to transport the first conveyor assembly 458 to any desired location such as a well site. The chassis 452 is coupled to the erecting mast assembly 456 and may further be configured to erect the first conveyor assembly 458 to an upright or vertical operational position for conveying oilfield material into a silo (which may be a modular silo), as discussed in more detail with reference to FIG. 5. The chassis 452 may cooperate with the erecting mast assembly 456 to move the first conveyor assembly 458 from a horizontal or transport position on the chassis 452 to an upright or vertical operational position. In some embodiments the chassis 452 may also be configured to be docked or otherwise aligned with a modular silo as will be described below. In yet some further aspects, chassis 452 may be adapted to dock an extended base of a system support frame.\\n[0042]\\nThe chassis 452 is provided with a support base 460 having a first end 464 (e.g., a front end) and a second end 466 (e.g., a rear end). The chassis 452 may also be provided with a support beam 468 extending between the first end 464 and the second end 466 of the support base 460, and a plurality of wheels 470 located at least partially underneath the support beam 468 (e.g., proximate to the second end 466) and operably connected to the support beam 468. The wheels 470 may be connected to one or more axles, and may include collapsible suspensions in some embodiments of the disclosure, such that the support base 460 may be positioned onto the ground when the suspension of the wheels 470 is collapsed.\\n[0043]\\nIn the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-2, the chassis 452 is provided with two support beams, e.g., 468-1 and 468-2, which are separated from one another by a gap 472 and may be connected together to collectively form a support base 460 via one or more transverse support members 474 (FIG. 2). The gap 472 extends longitudinally along the support base 460 between the first end 464 and the second end 466. The support beams 468-1 and 468-2 may be implemented as a steel beam, channel, I-beam, H-beam, wide flange, universal beam, rolled steel joist, or any other structure. In some embodiments of the disclosure a plurality of transverse support members 474 may be spaced a distance apart from one another between the first end 464 and the second end 466 of the support base 460, while extending between the support beams 468-1 and 468-2.\\n[0044]\\nThe gooseneck portion 462 extends from the first end 464 of support base 460 and is configured to connect the chassis 452 to a truck, such as truck 36, via a suitable trailer hitch, for example. Once the truck 36 has been disconnected from the gooseneck portion 462, the gooseneck portion 462 may be manipulated to lie on the ground and be generally co-planar with the support base 460 as shown in FIG. 6. In this configuration, in some cases the gooseneck portion 462 may form a ramp to allow an oilfield material delivery truck or trailer to be driven over or backed onto the support base 460. For example, the gooseneck portion 462 may be provided with a first section 476 and a second section 478. The first section 476 may extend from the first end 464 of the support base 460. The first section 476 has a first end 480 and a second end 482. The first end 480 of the first section 476 is movably connected to the support base 460, such as by the use of a set of hinges, voids and pins or other types of connectors which may be locked at more than one position. The second section 478 is movably connected to the second end 482 of the first section 476. For example, the first section 476 may be a four bar linkage which can be locked in an elevated position to form the gooseneck portion 462, or a lowered position to form a ramp. Any desired trailer hitch such as a gooseneck hitch having a structure known in the art as a ÒkingpinÓ, for example, may be implemented to connect the gooseneck portion 462 to the truck 36 as will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the disclosure.\\n[0045]\\nThe second conveyor system 454 can be implemented as any suitable conveyor-belt type transloader or auger, and may be associated with the support base 460 so that the second conveyor system 454 is positioned at least partially in the gap 472 between the support beams 468-1 and 468-2. In another embodiment, the second conveyor system 454 may be pivotably connected to the chassis 452 so as to move oilfield material towards the second end 466 of the chassis 452. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the second conveyor system 454 extends along a centerline of the support base 460 as shown in FIGS. 1-2. The second conveyor system 454 has a second conveyor 484 and a third conveyor 486. The second conveyor 484 may be recessed in the gap 472 and positioned substantially horizontally such that a top surface of the second conveyor 484 is positioned level with or below a top surface of the support beams 468-1 and 468-2, and is configured to allow an oilfield material transport truck or trailer positioned on the support base 460 to discharge, dump, or otherwise deposit a volume of oilfield material onto the second conveyor 484 and to transport the volume of oilfield material from the first end 464 toward the second end 466 of the support base 460. In some embodiments, the second conveyor 484 may be positioned at a centerline of the support base 460. The third conveyor 486 is positioned between the second conveyor 484 and the second end 466 of the chassis 452 and is configured to receive a volume of oilfield material from the second conveyor 484 and to transport the oilfield material towards the second end 466. As will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the second conveyor system 454 may include an auger, a conveyor belt with a smooth surface, or with cleated features for oilfield material transfer (e.g., in the third conveyor 486). Further, in some embodiments the second conveyor 484 may be open, and the third conveyor 486 may be enclosed, as will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the disclosure. The third conveyor 486 may positioned, in some aspects, at an upwardly inclined (non-zero, positive angle) with respect to the second conveyor 484.\\n[0046]\\nIn some embodiments of the disclosure, second conveyor system 454 may be pivotably connected with the support base 460 and/or the chassis 452 such that the second conveyor system 454 can be pivoted laterally from the support base 460 at any desired angle as shown in FIG. 5.\\n[0047]\\nThe erecting mast assembly 456 may include a mast 488 supported by the chassis 452, and an actuator system 490 engaging the mast 488 and the chassis 452. The erecting mast assembly 456 is configured to lay flat onto the support base 460 (e.g., onto the support beams 468-1 and 468-2) when the chassis 452 is transported, and to clear the second conveyor system 454 when the erecting mast assembly 456 is deployed to the upright or vertical operational position. The range of motion of the erecting mast assembly 456 may extend from horizontal to slightly past vertical (e.g., more than a 90 degree range of motion) when deployed to account for angular misalignment, due to ground height differences, for example. The erecting mast assembly 456 may be formed from steel tubing, beam, channel, I-beam, H-beam, wide flange, universal beam, rolled steel joist, or any other suitable material and shape.\\n[0048]\\nThe mast 488 may be supported by the support beams 468-1 and 468-2 of the chassis 452 proximate to the second end 466 of the chassis 452. The mast 488 is configured to support the first conveyor assembly 458 and to be moved between a horizontal position (FIG. 1) and a vertical position (FIG. 2) by the actuator system 490 to raise the first conveyor assembly 458 to the vertical position and to associate the first conveyor assembly 458 with a modular silo as will be described with reference to FIG. 5 below.\\n[0049]\\nThe mast 488 may be provided with a frame 492 including a first end 494, a second end 496, a first support beam 498-1 extending between the first end 494 and the second end 496, and a second support beam 498-2 extending between the first end 494 and the second end 496. The first and second support beams 498-1 and 498-2 may be spaced apart in a parallel orientation and configured to jointly support the first conveyor assembly 458 as will be described below.\\n[0050]\\nThe actuator system 490 engages the mast 488 and at least one of the support beams 468-1 and 486-2 of the chassis 452 to move the mast 488 in an arc-shaped path for moving the first conveyor assembly 458 between the horizontal and vertical positions. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the actuator system 490 may include a plurality of actuators 500-1 and 500-2 working in concert to move the mast 488 from the lateral position to the vertical position. However, it will be understood that the actuator system 490 may be implemented as a single actuator 500 or any number of actuators 500. The actuator(s) 500 may be implemented as hydraulic actuators, pneumatic actuators, electrical actuators, mechanical actuators, or any suitable mechanism capable of moving the mast 488 into the vertical position.\\n[0051]\\nThe first conveyor assembly 458 may be implemented as an enclosed vertical bucket elevator or an auger (e.g., not using airflow to carry the oilfield material), and may include a first conveyor 502 and a support frame 504 which is movably connected to the mast 488 of the erecting mast assembly 456 so that the first conveyor 502 is movable between a horizontal position where the first conveyor 502 lies flat onto the support base 460 during transport, and a vertical position where the first conveyor 502 is oriented vertically for transporting a volume or oilfield material into one or more modular silos. In some embodiments, the first conveyor 502 may be implemented and may function similarly to the vertical conveyor 32 described above.\\n[0052]\\nAs shown in FIG. 3, the support frame 504 may be movably connected to the mast 488 via one or more mechanical linkages 506 attached to the mast 488 and one or more actuators 508 configured to slide, or otherwise move the support frame 504 relative to the first end 494 of the mast 488 within a predetermined range. In some embodiments the actuators 508 may be implemented as hydraulic or pneumatic actuators. It is to be understood that the mechanical linkages 506 may be implemented in a variety of manners, such as rails (as shown in FIG. 3) hydraulic or pneumatic arms, gears, worm gear jacks, cables, or combinations thereof.\\n[0053]\\nReferring now to FIGS. 4-5, the first conveyor 502 may include an inlet 510 and an upper discharge portion 512. The inlet 510 may be positioned proximate and/or below the third conveyor 486 of the second conveyor system 454 such that a volume of oilfield material transported via the third conveyor 486 of the second conveyor system 454 enters the first conveyor 502 via the inlet 510.\\n[0054]\\nThe upper discharge portion 512 may include a discharge chute 514 which may be a dual-discharge chute configured to fill two or more modular silos 516 simultaneously, such as by having two or more outlets 517 operably coupled with two or more receiving chutes 518 of the modular silos 516, for example. In some embodiments, the discharge chute 514 may include a built-in diverter valve 520 (e.g., a three-position diverter valve) to allow the discharge chute 514 to fill one, two, or more than two modular silos 516 as will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art. The discharge chute 514 can interface, or otherwise be coupled with the receiving chutes 518 of the modular silos 516 in any desired manner protected from rain and/or moisture, for example, by including one or more rain-covers or shields.\\n[0055]\\nAs shown in FIG. 4, the support frame 504 may include one or more optional silo-engaging members 522, which may be implemented as hooks, L-shaped protrusions, flanges, or combinations thereof, for example. The silo-engaging members 522 may be configured to engage corresponding frame-attachment members 524 formed in the modular silo(s) 516, such that the support frame 504 and the first conveyor 502 may be securely attached, or otherwise associated with the modular silo(s) 516. As will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the silo-engaging members 522 and/or the frame-attachment members 524 may be omitted in some embodiments of the disclosure.\\n[0056]\\nReferring again to FIG. 1, in some embodiments an optional power supply system 526 may be implemented with the mobile oilfield material transfer unit 450, and may be configured to power the actuator system 490, the first conveyor 502, and the actuators 508. However, in some embodiments the power supply system 526 may be omitted, and the actuator system 490, the first conveyor assembly 458, and the actuators 508 may be powered by any desired power source, such as a power source associated with the modular silos 516, a separate generator, an electrical line connected to a grid or to a local power source, and combinations thereof. Some examples of power source types include, but are not limited to, electric, natural gas, liquid fuel, and the like. In some embodiments where the power supply system 526 is provided with the mobile oilfield material transfer unit 450, the power supply system 526 is desirably sized and positioned onto the support base 460 so as to not interfere with the operation and movement of the erecting mast assembly 456 and the second conveyor system 454.\\n[0057]\\nReferring now to FIG. 6, in operation a mobile oilfield material transfer unit 450 may function as follows: the truck 36 backs up the chassis 452 proximate to one or more modular silo 516 (e.g., a cooperating unit of two or more modular silos 516). When the truck 36 has been disconnected from chassis 452, the gooseneck portion 462 may be manipulated to lie on the ground and be generally co-planar with the support base 460 to form a ramp to allow an oilfield material transport trailer 528 to be driven over or backed onto the support base 460. The erecting mast assembly 456 is raised to the vertical position so as to raise the first conveyor assembly 458 to the vertical position as well. The actuators 508 may be operated to raise the first conveyor 502 to the upper limit of the predetermined range of movement of the actuators 508, by moving the support frame 504 relative to the first end 494 of the mast 488 (e.g., along the mechanical linkage 506). The position of the chassis 452 relative to the modular silo(s) 516 may be adjusted as needed (e.g., in three-dimensions, such as by moving the chassis 452, by docking or otherwise aligning the second end 466 of the chassis 452 with the modular silo(s) 516, and/or by collapsing a suspension of the chassis 452 to position the discharge chute 514 to engage with the receiving chutes 518. The actuators 508 may be operated to lower the first conveyor 502 over the modular silo(s) 516 such that the discharge chute 514 engages the receiving chutes 518. Optionally, lowering the first conveyor 502 may also cause the silo-engaging members 522 to engage with the corresponding frame-attachment members 524, such that the support frame 504 of the first conveyor assembly 458 is securely attached, or otherwise associated with the modular silo(s) 516 causing the discharge chutes 514 to be aligned with the receiving chutes 518 of the modular silo(s).\\n[0058]\\nThe oilfield material transport trailer 528 may be backed over the chassis 452, such that discharge openings (not shown) of the oilfield material transport trailer 528 are positioned over and vertically aligned with the second conveyor 484 of the second conveyor system 454.

More specifically, aspects of the disclosure relate to performing water line control for sample bottle filling.\\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\\n[0003]\\nDownhole testing is required during different phases of oil field service work. Such downhole testing allows engineers and operators to identify specific geological features of interest. Geological features and parameters that are typically of interest may include, as a non-limiting example, the presence of hydrocarbons or water. Hydrocarbons, such as oil or gas, are highly desired. Formation tester sample bottles are used to accept the oil, gas, water or combination of water, oil and gas.\\n[0004]\\nFormation tester sample bottle filling is traditionally controlled at the inlet of a sample bottle. A downhole pump is used to pump formation fluid through a flowline past a sample receptacle located downstream of this pump. The fluid is routed to the borehole through an exit port until such time that sample capture is desired. At this time a valve at the bottle inlet is opened. To ensure the sample flows into the receptacle the flowline exit to borehole is closed. Fluid is then forced into the bottle by the pump. When the bottle is filled, the pump can continue to run until the fluid in the bottle is over pressured to the pump limit. A valve at the bottle inlet is subsequently closed, trapping the sampled fluid in the bottle.\\n[0005]\\nConventional tester sample bottles have many compromises associated with their design. Such conventional systems have limitations on their sampling and can shock fluids during sampling.\\nSUMMARY\\n[0006]\\nThis summary is not intended to limit the aspects described in the description. In one example embodiment, an arrangement for sampling a fluid is provided having, a sample bottle with an associated piston wherein the piston separates the sample bottle into an inlet side and a water side, a fluid sample line connected to the sample bottle at the inlet side, the fluid sample line transporting a fluid, and a relief valve connected to the sample bottle connected to the water side of the sample bottle, such that actuation of the relief valve causes fluid to be accepted into the sample bottle with the associated piston.\\n[0007]\\nIn another embodiment an arrangement for sampling a fluid is provided having a sample bottle with an associated piston, wherein the piston separates the sample bottle into an inlet side and a water side, a fluid sample line connected to the sample bottle at the inlet side, the fluid sample line transporting a fluid, a solenoid connected to the sample bottle on the water side of the sample bottle, and a check valve connected to the sample bottle on the water side of sample bottle, wherein fluid enters the sample bottle on the inlet side upon actuation of at least one of the solenoid and the check valve on the water side of the sample bottle.\\n[0008]\\nIn a further embodiment described, a method is provided for directing a fluid flow into a sample bottle; comprising: pumping the fluid flow with a pump through a fluid transfer line, hydraulically locking a piston in the sample bottle, wherein a fluid below the piston is pressure equalized to a pressure of the wellbore, accepting fluid from the fluid transfer line into the sample bottle through an inlet of the sample bottle, wherein a fluid pressure of the fluid in the fluid transfer line is at a pressure over that for actuation of a relief valve pressure thereby causing the fluid to enter the sample bottle, and sealing the bottle after an amount of fluid has been accepted into the sample bottle.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n[0009]\\nFIG. 1 is a cross-section of a sample bottle and associated valve configurations with a solenoid and check valve.\\n[0010]\\nFIG. 2 is a cross-section of a sample bottle and associated valve configuration with a relief valve.\\n[0011]\\nFIG. 3 is a cross-section of a sample bottle and associated valve configuration with a relief valve and a check valve.\\n[0012]\\nFIG. 4 is a cross-section of a sample bottle and associated valve configuration with a relief valve, check valve and solenoid.\\n[0013]\\nFIG. 5 is a first configuration of sample bottle and associated valve configuration at a position where fluid starts to flow to the sample bottle in a low shock sampling method.\\n[0014]\\nFIG. 6 is the configuration of FIG. 5 when fluid flows from the formation through a pump into the bottle at sufficient pressure to overcome wellbore and relief valve pressure.\\n[0015]\\nFIG. 7 is the configuration of FIG. 5 when the piston has reached the bottom and a sealing action is triggered automatically.\\n[0016]\\nFIG. 8 is a second configuration of a sample bottle and associated valve configuration for a reverse low shock sampling method wherein the piston as a starting position before fluid flow.\\n[0017]\\nFIG. 9 is the second configuration of FIG. 8 when fluid is drawn from the water side through a solenoid forcing down the piston.\\n[0018]\\nFIG. 10 is the second configuration of FIG. 8 when the piston reaches the bottom and a sealing action is automatically triggered.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\\n[0019]\\nFour individual concepts are provided for water line control of sample bottle filling. Each of the concepts labeled A, B, C and D provide an alternative sample bottle filling method compared to conventional techniques. The sample bottles may be used in downhole tools to conduct sampling of fluids from geological formations. Sample bottles for other sampling may also be filled through the methods and arrangements provided, such as, for example, sampling of fluids from environments. Such environments may be gaseous environments, either man-made or natural. Such configurations described herein may also be used for sampling in laboratory conditions and as such, although the described embodiments relate to testing in field conditions, such descriptions should not be considered limiting.\\n[0020]\\nThe configurations provided relate to sample bottles of varying sizes and shapes and therefore the elongated shape provided in the appended FIGS. should not be considered limiting. The sample bottles allow for sampling fluids and may be insulated, placed in a detachable carrier or otherwise protected to prevent the contents of the sample bottle from becoming mixed with other fluids. Such sample carriers may be opened at the wellsite surface or may be transported to a laboratory for further analysis.\\n[0021]\\nA first concept, A, is provided for water line control of sample bottle filling. The water side of the sample bottle contains a check valve and a solenoid. The purpose of the solenoid is to control the sample bottle piston position by regulating the water behind the piston. When the solenoid opens the piston can move when flowline pressure exceeds water side pressure. There is a check valve placed parallel to the solenoid that allows the water pressure to be equalized to hydrostatic pressure. This is necessary to manage water (and air bubbles) compressibility. Without the check valve this compressibility would result in piston movement when the tool is lowered into the well. The bottle will self-seal after filling, or an inlet valve can be closed after filling.\\n[0022]\\nA second concept, B, is provided also for water line control of sample bottle filling. The water side of the sample bottle contains a relief valve. The purpose of the relief valve is to maintain a constant, higher than hydrostatic, pressure in the bottle during the entire filling process. An additional benefit of the relief valve is that the sampled fluid can be over pressure when used with self sealing bottles. With the traditional filling method described above a self sealing bottle cannot be over pressurized with the downhole pump. Additionally, in some instances, such as a nitrogen charge, an overpressure situation may occur. The over pressuring requires the bottle to be filled, but the bottle will self seal at this time. With the relief valve indicated in the concept provided in FIG. 2, any fluid entering the bottle is already at high pressure and no post-filling pressurization is required.\\n[0023]\\nA third concept, C, is provided for water line control of sample bottle filling. The water side of the sample bottle contains a check valve and a relief valve. The purpose of the relief valve is the same as described in Concept B. The check valve will ensure that the water side pressure is equal to hydrostatic while the tool is lowered into the well. The bottle will self-seal after filling, or an inlet valve can be closed after filling.\\n[0024]\\nA fourth concept, D, is provided for water line control of sample bottle filling. This arrangement is a combination of the above described concepts. The solenoid now controls the piston movement and the water equalization. When sample capture is desired, the solenoid can be opened. First the water pressure will equalize to hydrostatic. Subsequently, the flowline exit to the borehole will be closed. This will increase flowline pressure unit the pressure exceeds the relief valve opening pressure. The bottle is then filled and the solenoid can be closed again to lock the piston back into position.\\n[0025]\\nAs provided in FIG. 1, the arrangement described above in relation to Concept A is provided. In FIG. 1, a sample bottle 18 is provided. The sample bottle 18 has an internal piston that may be used to capture fluid from a formation. The sample bottle 18 is found, for example, in downhole fluid analysis tools. The left end of the sample bottle 18 is the inlet 12 to the sample bottle 18. At the right side of the sample bottle 18, an open solenoid 20 is positioned next to a check valve 22. Through this configuration, water line control may be established for sample bottle filling.\\n[0026]\\nAs provided in FIG. 2, the arrangement described above in relation to Concept B is provided. As provided in FIG. 2. a sample bottle 18 is provided. The sample bottle 18 has an internal piston that may be used to capture fluid from a formation. The sample bottle 18 is found, for example, in downhole fluid analysis tools. The left end of the sample bottle 18 is the inlet 12 to the sample bottle 18. At the right side of the sample bottle 18, a relief valve 24 is positioned to provide pressure relief from the sample bottle 18. Through this configuration, water line control may be established for sample bottle filling.\\n[0027]\\nAs provided in FIG. 3, the arrangement described above in relation to Concept C is provided. As provided in FIG. 3, a sample bottle 18 is provided. The sample bottle 18 has an internal piston that may be used to capture fluid from a formation. The sample bottle 18 is found, for example, in downhole fluid analysis tools. The left end of the sample bottle 18 is the inlet 12 to the sample bottle 18. At the right side of the sample bottle 18, a relief valve 26 is positioned next to a check valve 28. Through this configuration, water line control may be established for sample bottle filling.\\n[0028]\\nAs provided in FIG. 4, the arrangement described above in relation to Concept D is provided. As provided in FIG. 4, a sample bottle 18 is provided. The sample bottle 18 has an internal piston that may be used to capture fluid from a formation. The sample bottle 18 is found, for example, in downhole fluid analysis tools. The left end of the sample bottle 18 is the inlet 12 to the sample bottle 18. At the right side of the sample bottle 18, a relief valve 30 is positioned next to a check valve. Both the relief valve 30 and the check valve 32 have a common solenoid arrangement 34. Through this configuration, water line control may be established for sample bottle filling.\\n[0029]\\nReferring to FIG. 5, a sample bottle 18 is provided in a low shock sampling condition. The configuration used in FIG. 5 may be, for example, that used in concept D (FIG. 4). The sample bottle 18 has an internal piston that may be used to capture fluid from a formation. In the illustrated example, the shaded region indicates the amount of fluid in the sample bottle 18, wherein the shaded region indicates a lack of fluid and a white region expresses a captured fluid. The sample bottle 18 is found, for example, in downhole fluid analysis tools. An open seal valve A is located along a hydraulic fluid line traveling from a pump to a wellbore environment. In the configuration of FIG. 5, fluid can flow from the wellbore down the hydraulic flow line above seal valve A to the pump (through open seal valve A). The piston inside the sample bottle 18 is hydraulically locked in position. Fluid below the piston is pressure equalized to the wellbore. As indicated by the shaded region, no fluid has yet entered into the sample bottle 18.\\n[0030]\\nReferring to FIG. 6, the configuration provided above in FIG. 5 is shown wherein fluid flows from the formation through the pump (located along the fluid flow line near point 38 to the right of the bottle 18) into the bottle 18 at sufficient pressure to overcome wellbore and relief valve pressure. Water flows from the bottle 18 through the solenoid 34.\\n[0031]\\nReferring to FIG. 7, when the piston reaches the bottom in the sample bottle 18, a sealing action at the bottom inlet is triggered. Such triggering may be accomplished automatically. At this stage, the bottle 18 may be removed to the surface for recovery of fluid.\\n[0032]\\nReferring to FIG. 8, a reverse low shock sampling arrangement is illustrated. In this configuration, fluid flows from the formation to the pump through valve A. The piston 18 is hydraulically locked in position. Fluid pressure below the piston 18 can build up through the check valve.\\n[0033]\\nReferring to FIG. 9, a sampling step is provided where fluid is drawn from the water side through the solenoid forcing down the piston. Fluid from the formation is drawn into the bottle with the piston movement.\\n[0034]\\nReferring to FIG. 10, the arrangement is provided wherein the piston has reached the bottom. A sealing action at the bottom inlet is triggered. The triggering may be performed automatically. After the sealing action has occurred, the tool may be brought back to the surface.\\n[0035]\\nIn all of the embodiments, illustrated, the configuration provided may be used to fill one sample bottle. In another configuration, a series of sample bottles that may be configured in an arrangement such that the sample bottles are filled in series or in parallel.\\n[0036]\\nDiffering aspects are considered part of this disclosure, including an arrangement for sampling a fluid, compromising a sample bottle with an associated piston, wherein the piston separates the sample bottle into an inlet side and a water side, a fluid sample line connected to the sample bottle at the inlet side, the fluid sample line transporting a fluid, a solenoid connected to the sample bottle on the water side of the sample bottle and a check valve connected to the sample bottle on the water side of sample bottle, wherein fluid enters the sample bottle on the inlet side upon actuation of at least one of the solenoid and the check valve on the water side of the sample bottle.\\n[0037]\\nA different aspect is also described, wherein an arrangement for sampling a fluid is provided, compromising a sample bottle with an associated piston wherein the piston separates the sample bottle into an inlet side and a water side, a fluid sample line connected to the sample bottle at the inlet side, the fluid sample line transporting a fluid;

Some operations in the processing procedures, methods, techniques, and workflows disclosed herein may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.\\nFIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system 100 that includes various management components 110 to manage various aspects of a geologic environment 150 (e.g., an environment that includes a sedimentary basin, a reservoir 151, one or more faults 153-1, one or more geobodies 153-2, etc.). For example, the management components 110 may allow for direct or indirect management of sensing, drilling, injecting, extracting, etc., with respect to the geologic environment 150. In turn, further information about the geologic environment 150 may become available as feedback 160 (e.g., optionally as input to one or more of the management components 110).\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the management components 110 include a seismic data component 112, an additional information component 114 (e.g., well/logging data), a processing component 116, a simulation component 120, an attribute component 130, an analysis/visualization component 142, and a workflow component 144. In operation, seismic data and other information provided per the components 112 and 114 may be input to the simulation component 120.\\nIn an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may rely on entities 122. Entities 122 may include earth entities or geological objects such as wells, surfaces, bodies, reservoirs, etc. In the system 100, the entities 122 can include virtual representations of actual physical entities that are reconstructed for purposes of simulation. The entities 122 may include entities based on data acquired via sensing, observation, etc. (e.g., the seismic data 112 and other information 114). An entity may be characterized by one or more properties (e.g., a geometrical pillar grid entity of an earth model may be characterized by a porosity property). Such properties may represent one or more measurements (e.g., acquired data), calculations, etc.\\nIn an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may operate in conjunction with a software framework such as an object-based framework. In such a framework, entities may include entities based on pre-defined classes to facilitate modeling and simulation. A commercially available example of an object-based framework is the MICROSOFT¨ .NET¨ framework (Redmond, Wash.), which provides a set of extensible object classes. In the .NET¨ framework, an object class encapsulates a module of reusable code and associated data structures. Object classes can be used to instantiate object instances for use by a program, script, etc. For example, borehole classes may define objects for representing boreholes based on well data.\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the simulation component 120 may process information to conform to one or more attributes specified by the attribute component 130, which may include a library of attributes. Such processing may occur prior to input to the simulation component 120 (e.g., consider the processing component 116). As an example, the simulation component 120 may perform operations on input information based on one or more attributes specified by the attribute component 130. In an example embodiment, the simulation component 120 may construct one or more models of the geologic environment 150, which may be relied on to simulate behavior of the geologic environment 150 (e.g., responsive to one or more acts, whether natural or artificial). In the example of FIG. 1, the analysis/visualization component 142 may allow for interaction with a model or model-based results (e.g., simulation results, etc.). As an example, output from the simulation component 120 may be input to one or more other workflows, as indicated by a workflow component 144.\\nAs an example, the simulation component 120 may include one or more features of a simulator such as the ECLIPSEª reservoir simulator (Schlumberger Limited, Houston Tex.), the INTERSECTª reservoir simulator (Schlumberger Limited, Houston Tex.), etc. As an example, a simulation component, a simulator, etc. may include features to implement one or more meshless techniques (e.g., to solve one or more equations, etc.). As an example, a reservoir or reservoirs may be simulated with respect to one or more enhanced recovery techniques (e.g., consider a thermal process such as SAGD, etc.).\\nIn an example embodiment, the management components 110 may include features of a commercially available framework such as the PETREL¨ seismic to simulation software framework (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.). The PETREL¨ framework provides components that allow for optimization of exploration and development operations. The PETREL¨ framework includes seismic to simulation software components that can output information for use in increasing reservoir performance, for example, by improving asset team productivity. Through use of such a framework, various professionals (e.g., geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers) can develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes. Such a framework may be considered an application and may be considered a data-driven application (e.g., where data is input for purposes of modeling, simulating, etc.).\\nIn an example embodiment, various aspects of the management components 110 may include add-ons or plug-ins that operate according to specifications of a framework environment. For example, a commercially available framework environment marketed as the OCEAN¨ framework environment (Schlumberger Limited, Houston, Tex.) allows for integration of add-ons (or plug-ins) into a PETREL¨ framework workflow. The OCEAN¨ framework environment leverages .NET¨ tools (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.) and offers stable, user-friendly interfaces for efficient development. In an example embodiment, various components may be implemented as add-ons (or plug-ins) that conform to and operate according to specifications of a framework environment (e.g., according to application programming interface (API) specifications, etc.).\\nFIG. 1 also shows an example of a framework 170 that includes a model simulation layer 180 along with a framework services layer 190, a framework core layer 195 and a modules layer 175. The framework 170 may include the commercially available OCEAN¨ framework where the model simulation layer 180 is the commercially available PETREL¨ model-centric software package that hosts OCEAN¨ framework applications. In an example embodiment, the PETREL¨ software may be considered a data-driven application. The PETREL¨ software can include a framework for model building and visualization.\\nAs an example, a framework may include features for implementing one or more mesh generation techniques. For example, a framework may include an input component for receipt of information from interpretation of seismic data, one or more attributes based at least in part on seismic data, log data, image data, etc. Such a framework may include a mesh generation component that processes input information, optionally in conjunction with other information, to generate a mesh.\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the model simulation layer 180 may provide domain objects 182, act as a data source 184, provide for rendering 186 and provide for various user interfaces 188. Rendering 186 may provide a graphical environment in which applications can display their data while the user interfaces 188 may provide a common look and feel for application user interface components.\\nAs an example, the domain objects 182 can include entity objects, property objects and optionally other objects. Entity objects may be used to geometrically represent wells, surfaces, bodies, reservoirs, etc., while property objects may be used to provide property values as well as data versions and display parameters. For example, an entity object may represent a well where a property object provides log information as well as version information and display information (e.g., to display the well as part of a model).\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, data may be stored in one or more data sources (or data stores, generally physical data storage devices), which may be at the same or different physical sites and accessible via one or more networks. The model simulation layer 180 may be configured to model projects. As such, a particular project may be stored where stored project information may include inputs, models, results and cases. Thus, upon completion of a modeling session, a user may store a project. At a later time, the project can be accessed and restored using the model simulation layer 180, which can recreate instances of the relevant domain objects.\\nIn the example of FIG. 1, the geologic environment 150 may include layers (e.g., stratification) that include a reservoir 151 and one or more other features such as the fault 153-1, the geobody 153-2, etc. As an example, the geologic environment 150 may be outfitted with any of a variety of sensors, detectors, actuators, etc. For example, equipment 152 may include communication circuitry to receive and to transmit information with respect to one or more networks 155. Such information may include information associated with downhole equipment 154, which may be equipment to acquire information, to assist with resource recovery, etc. Other equipment 156 may be located remote from a well site and include sensing, detecting, emitting or other circuitry. Such equipment may include storage and communication circuitry to store and to communicate data, instructions, etc. As an example, one or more satellites may be provided for purposes of communications, data acquisition, etc. For example, FIG. 1 shows a satellite in communication with the network 155 that may be configured for communications, noting that the satellite may additionally or include circuitry for imagery (e.g., spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric, etc.).\\nFIG. 1 also shows the geologic environment 150 as optionally including equipment 157 and 158 associated with a well that includes a substantially horizontal portion that may intersect with one or more fractures 159. For example, consider a well in a shale formation that may include natural fractures, artificial fractures (e.g., hydraulic fractures) or a combination of natural and artificial fractures. As an example, a well may be drilled for a reservoir that is laterally extensive. In such an example, lateral variations in properties, stresses, etc. may exist where an assessment of such variations may assist with planning, operations, etc. to develop a laterally extensive reservoir (e.g., via fracturing, injecting, extracting, etc.). As an example, the equipment 157 and/or 158 may include components, a system, systems, etc. for fracturing, seismic sensing, analysis of seismic data, assessment of one or more fractures, etc.\\nAs mentioned, the system 100 may be used to perform one or more workflows. A workflow may be a process that includes a number of worksteps. A workstep may operate on data, for example, to create new data, to update existing data, etc. As an example, a workstep may operate on one or more inputs and create one or more results, for example, based on one or more algorithms. As an example, a system may include a workflow editor for creation, editing, executing, etc. of a workflow. In such an example, the workflow editor may provide for selection of one or more pre-defined worksteps, one or more customized worksteps, etc. As an example, a workflow may be a workflow implementable in the PETREL¨ software, for example, that operates on seismic data, seismic attribute(s), etc. As an example, a workflow may be a process implementable in the OCEAN¨ framework. As an example, a workflow may include one or more worksteps that access a module such as a plug-in (e.g., external executable code, etc.).\\nEmbodiments of the present disclosure may provide a consistent and robust numerical technique for solving linear systems of equations arising from the linearization of nonlinear parabolic or elliptic partial differential equations of fluid flow in heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. Numerical frameworks for Adaptive Deflated Multiscale Solvers (ADMS) facilitate an analysis of nonlinear problem mixed hyperbolic/parabolic partial differential equations of fluid flow in heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. Further, ADMS methods provide, for fluid flow in porous media involving heterogeneous domains with long coherent structures with high contrasts (e.g. fractures, faults, high and low permeability channels, and shale layers), a good approximation of the pressure field. In various embodiments, high contrasts can be of order 102 and higher.\\nAccurate and efficient simulation of flow in highly heterogeneous oil reservoirs entails several challenges, one of which is due to the large scale ratios between the domain size and the resolution of the heterogeneous geological data. Traditionally, upscaling approaches have been used to obtain effective coarse-scale quantities so that the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) is reduced enough such that the problem lies within the capacity range of state-of-the-art reservoir simulators (e.g., on the order of 106-107 DOF). Similar to upscaling methods, multiscale methods can be used in order to construct an accurate coarse-scale system honoring the fine-scale heterogeneous data.\\nThe multiscale coarse-scale system is governed on the basis of locally computed basis functions, subject to reduced-dimensional boundary conditions and zero right-hand-side (RHS) terms. In contrast to upscaling methods, however, multiscale methods provide an improved solution at the original fine-scale resolution, and the multiscale finite volume (MSFV) method can deliver conservative fine-scale velocities after a local reconstruction. This addition may then allow for the calculation of the residual of the multiscale solution in fulfillment of the governing equations at the original fine-scale resolution. Thus, an iterative strategy can be developed (e.g., iterative multiscale finite volume (i-MSFV), two-scale multiscale solver (TAMS), algebraic multiscale solver (AMS), or compressible flow algebraic multiscale solver (C-AMS)) so that the multiscale error in combination with a multiscale smoother would be systematically reduced in a convergent procedure.\\nPreviously iterative multiscale methods share the same coarse-scale system to capture the low-frequency errors, which is based on either a MSFV or multiscale finite element (MSFE) procedure. MSFE may be more efficient for highly heterogeneous channelized fields. More precisely, an AMS could be used where the MSFE and an incomplete lower upper preconditioner (ILU(0)) could resolve low and high frequency errors, respectively. This may be extended for compressible problems (C-AMS). AMS and C-AMS iterative multiscale solvers may be as efficient as an industrial Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) solver, such as SAMG. However, for highly heterogeneous anisotropic cases, the number of iterations performed by AMS and C-AMS were more than that of the SAMG. The reason can be related to the weak information in the coarse-scale system used to resolve low-frequency error modes.\\nAn embodiment of the present disclosure may apply to fluid flow in porous media involving heterogeneous domains with long coherent structures with high contrasts (e.g. fractures, faults, high and low permeability channels, and shale layers). Therefore, the strong variations and discontinuities in the reservoir properties (i.e., large jumps) may be observed in the matrix coefficients after discretization. As a result, the underlying linearized problem may be badly-conditioned. Such severe discontinuities could lead to extreme eigenvalues of the linearized problem. Consequently, extreme eigenvalues can reduce the convergence rate of the linear solver. The deflation technique, which can be used for symmetric systems and the conjugate gradient (CG) method, can be used to overcome extreme eigenvalues by deflating problematic eigenvalues from the symmetric or non-symmetric linear system.\\nThe performance of the multiscale methods is also affected by the presence of the large jumps in the reservoir properties. As a result, a number of different methods for improving the accuracy of the localization assumption can be used, e.g., by introducing reduced problem boundary conditions, oversampling techniques, and global information. Various adaptive deflation-based multiscale solvers (ADMS) can be used to improve the AMS convergence properties for heterogeneous domains with long coherent structures with high contrasts. The methods may separate the long features and apply an additional stage or multiple stages to the original AMS iterative stage. These additional stages are formulated based on an adaptive deflation strategy, where the ÒcriticalÓ subdomains are detected honoring their complex geometrical configurations. For these subdomains, global deflation-based basis functions are introduced. Then, combining AMS classical iterative strategy with an adaptive-deflated global stage allows for resolving the low frequency error modes associated with these features. The global deflation-based basis functions are constructed using a small number of approximated eigenvectors which are prolonged to the fine-scale and correspond to the smallest Ritz (or Harmonic Ritz) values. Several enriched multiscale approaches can be used, e.g., with additional spectral local problems solved in order to complement the original multiscale basis functions, from a Domain Decomposition (DD) perspective, to improve the convergence property of the local-basis-function-based coarse-scale preconditioners. Specifically, a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map problem may be solved locally to capture additional low-frequency modes which were not captured by the original multiscale coarse systems. Another approach may include detection of the ÒcriticalÓ subdomain, where a residual-based error criterion was used to detect the regions where the multiscale solutions could be improved. An additional coarse DOF may be added arbitrarily at the location of a high residual in order to improve the convergence properties of the i-MSFV.\\nThe ADMS methods are adaptive in the employment of the deflation stage, with minimum change in the original AMS (or any other i-MSFV strategy) framework. Thus, the methods combine the local-basis-function-based multiscale coarse system with another global stage solver, based on the missing global information, in an efficient manner.\\nGoverning Equations and Discretization on Fine Scale\\nConservation of mass for multi-component and multiphase fluid flow in porous media using Darcy's law leads to a system of nonlinear coupled equations for Nc components distributed in Np phases, which may be written using natural variables as follows:\\n¶\\n¶\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\n_\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nij\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n)\\n-\\n_\\ná\\n(\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nij\\n_\\nð\\nð\\ná\\n(\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n+\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n_\\n_\\nð\\n)\\n)\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n,\\n(\\n1\\n)\\nð\\n=\\n1\\n,\\nÉ\\n_\\n,\\nð\\nð\\n;\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n=\\n1\\n;\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nij\\n=\\n1\\n_\\n_\\nð\\n=\\n1\\n,\\nÉ\\n_\\n,\\nð\\nð\\n(\\n2\\n)\\n\\nwhere _ is the porosity, xij is the molar fraction of component i in phase j,Sj,pj,_j,_ j, and\\nð\\nð\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\nð\\n)\\nð\\nð\\n\\nare phase saturation, pressure, molar density, mass density and mobilities, respectively; k(Sj) and _j are the relative permeability and viscosity of the phase j. The gravitational acceleration is denoted by g, which acts in z direction. Moreover, qi is the component sink/source term. Mass balance of pseudo-component i=o, g, w (black-oil formulation) is considered. A sequential approach can be used to solve governing equations Equation 1 and Equation 2. The sequential approach facilitates separating the impact of a timestep sizes selection algorithm on the solution stability and convergence behaviors for both reservoir pressure (parabolic or elliptic equation) and transport governing equations (hyperbolic equations). Sequential approaches form a pressure equation which can be obtained by performing discretization on tn; tn+1 and elimination of Sj n+1. The pressure p at tn+1 solves (for black-oil formulation) the following equation:\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\nð\\n+\\n1\\n)\\n-\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\nð\\n+\\n1\\n)\\ná\\nð\\nð\\nð\\ná\\nð\\nij\\nð\\ná\\nð\\nð\\ná\\nð\\nð\\nð\\n-\\nð\\n_\\n_\\nð\\n_\\n·\\nð\\n=\\n1\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\nð\\n+\\n1\\n)\\ná\\n_\\ná\\n(\\nð\\nij\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\n_\\nð\\nð\\n+\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n_\\n_\\nð\\n)\\n)\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n,\\n(\\n3\\n)\\n\\nwhere _t is the time step, and Qi is the updated sink/source term, where:\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\n)\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n-\\n1\\n_\\n(\\n1\\n+\\nð\\ngo\\nð\\nð\\n_\\nð\\n)\\n,\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\n)\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n-\\n1\\n,\\nð\\nð\\n_\\n(\\nð\\n)\\n=\\nð\\nð\\n-\\n1\\n(\\n4\\n)\\n\\nare the weights (multipliers), with the assumptions that a water component is in water w phase, oil is in oil o phase, and gas splits into oil xgo and gas xgg=1 phases. A more general formulation and the relationship between mass fractions xij and standard black-oil formulation parameters, e.g., solution gas ratio Rs, may also be provided.\\nIn a sequential approach method, the pressure equation (parabolic or elliptic equation) can be converged for a longer time step than it is possible to converge transport solver (hyperbolic) equations. Hence, the present method solves for the pressure equation with the global timestep while applying several sub-timesteps for the transport solution. The linearized form of Equation 3 after being discretized over fine-scale control volumes leads to a non-symmetric linear system:\\nA _ p _ =b _,__(5)\\nwhich may be iteratively solved until the converged solution is obtained. The velocity is computed from the converged solution of this system, pn+1, which is then employed in a sequential strategy to update the component masses (or phase saturations) in a sequential strategy (i.e., Equation 1). If a fully implicit (FIM) simulation strategy is followed, Equation 3 is linearized considering the pressure and saturation dependencies in at least some equations. The resulting coupled system can then be solved simultaneously for the unknowns. In either embodiment, i.e., sequential or FIM, and in at least some other examples, an efficient and accurate solution of the pressure equation may be desired, and due to high heterogeneity contrasts with wide ranges of correlation lengths in the mobility field (i.e., rock heterogeneity), adaptive deflated multiscale solvers (ADMS) may be employed to further advance the multiscale solvers for computationally expensive cases.\\nAlgebraic Multiscale Solver (AMS)\\nConsider the fine-scale linear system for pressure at a given iteration _. Denoting matrix A_, pressure solution p_, and the right-hand side b_ for an iteration _ for Af, pf, and bf, respectively. The system of Equation 5 for iteration _ can be written as:\\nA f p f =b f__(6)\\nwith a highly heterogeneous coefficient matrix. Given the multiscale system, i.e., Equation 6, multiscale solvers construct a coarse-scale system by applying a restriction operator R, solving the solution at a coarse level, and then prolonging (interpolating) it back to the original fine-scale system by using a prolongation operator P.\\nThe prolongation operator P is constructed based on local solutions of the fine-scale problem with zero RHS terms, i.e., basis functions. The local support for the basis functions is obtained by first imposing a coarse grid (__k) on the given grid cells. Then selecting one coarse node inside each control volume, i.e., coarse-grid cell. By connecting the coarse nodes, the dual-coarse grid cells, which are the local supports of basis function calculations, are obtained ({tilde over (½)}h). There are nc and nd coarse and dual-coarse cells, respectively, imposed on nf fine-grid cells.\\nFIG. 2 illustrates an example of multiscale grids, according to an embodiment.

For example, when utilized in cased boreholes, such ultrasonic imaging may be performed to inspect the casing and the cement securing the casing in the borehole. When utilized in open boreholes, ultrasonic imaging may be performed to obtain an image of the borehole surface, such as to identify vugs, fractures, texture, and acoustic properties of the subterranean formation penetrated by the borehole.\\n[0003]\\nUltrasonic transducers of such imaging tools are generally pressure-compensated in order to be able to withstand the increased pressure differential between the surface and the bottom of the borehole. Therefore, acquisition electronics and the transducers of the imaging tools are disposed in an oil-filled cavity electrically connected to the rest of the tool via bulk connectors, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,286,475, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.\\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\\n[0004]\\nThis summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify indispensable features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.\\n[0005]\\nThe present disclosure introduces an apparatus including a downhole acoustic measurement tool that includes at least one transducer for emitting acoustic excitation signals and/or receiving echo signals to perform downhole measurements. The downhole acoustic measurement tool also includes a backing in contact with an inner surface of the at least one transducer, a first structure mechanically coupled to a first housing, and a second structure mechanically coupled to a second housing. The downhole acoustic measurement tool also includes a longitudinally extending member that includes a first portion, a second portion, and a third portion. The first portion is mechanically coupled to the first structure. The second portion is mechanically coupled to the second structure. At least one of the first and second structures is mechanically coupled to the member and thereby has a longitudinal degree of freedom relative to the member. The third portion extends longitudinally through the backing between the first and second portions such that compressional longitudinal forces experienced by the first and second housings are transferred through the first and second structures and the backing.\\n[0006]\\nThe present disclosure also introduces an apparatus including a downhole acoustic tool that includes at least one transducer for emitting acoustic excitation signals and/or receiving echo signals to perform downhole measurements, a backing in contact with an inner surface of the at least one transducer, and an acoustically transparent canister forming an external surface of the downhole acoustic tool. The canister contacts an outer surface of the at least one transducer so as to exert radial forces on the at least one transducer when placed in an environment having a pressure at or higher than atmospheric pressure.\\n[0007]\\nThese and additional aspects of the present disclosure are set forth in the description that follows, and/or may be learned by a person having ordinary skill in the art by reading the material herein and/or practicing the principles described herein. At least some aspects of the present disclosure may be achieved via means recited in the attached claims.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\n[0008]\\nThe present disclosure is understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures. It is emphasized that, in accordance with the standard practice in the industry, various features are not drawn to scale. In fact, the dimensions of the various features may be arbitrarily increased or reduced for clarity of discussion.\\n[0009]\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic view of at least a portion of an example implementation of apparatus according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure.\\n[0010]\\nFIG. 2 is a sectional view of at least a portion of an example implementation of apparatus according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure.\\n[0011]\\nFIG. 3 is a sectional view of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 .\\n[0012]\\nFIG. 4 is a sectional view of another example implementation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 .\\n[0013]\\nFIG. 5 is a perspective view of a portion of an example implementation of apparatus according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure.\\n[0014]\\nFIG. 6 is a perspective view of a portion of an example implementation of apparatus according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure.\\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\\n[0015]\\nIt is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numbers and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. Moreover, the description of a first feature in contact with a second feature in the description that follows may include implementations in which the first and second features are in direct contact, and may also include implementations in which additional features may interpose the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact.\\n[0016]\\nFIG. 1 is a schematic view of at least a portion of an example implementation of a wellsite system 100 to which one or more aspects of the present disclosure may be applicable. The wellsite system 100 may be onshore (as depicted) or offshore. In the example wellsite system 100 shown in FIG. 1 , a toolstring 104 is conveyed in a borehole 108 via a wireline, slickline, and/or other conveyance means 112. The example wellsite system 100 may be utilized for evaluation of the borehole 108, cement 116 securing casing 120 within the borehole 108, a tubular (not shown) secured in the casing 120 (e.g., production services tubing), and/or a subterranean formation 124 penetrated by the borehole 108 in a cased section 150 and/or an open hole section 155. Although the majority of the wellbore 108 is depicted in FIG. 1 as being cased, a majority of the wellbore may be uncased (Òopen,Ó without the casing 120 and cement 116).\\n[0017]\\nThe toolstring 104 is suspended in the borehole 108 from the lower end of the conveyance means 112. The conveyance means 112 may be a single- or multi-conductor slickline or wireline logging cable spooled on a drum 113 of a winch 115 at the surface 128 of the wellsite from whence the borehole 108 extends. The wellsite surface 128 is the generally planar surface of the terrain (i.e., Earth's surface), a floor of a rig (not shown) at the wellsite, or other equipment at the wellsite, which is perpendicularly penetrated by the borehole 108. Operation of the winch 115 rotates the drum 113 to reel in the conveyance means 112 and thereby pull the toolstring 104 in an uphole direction 101 in the borehole 108, as well as to reel out the conveyance means 112 and thereby move the toolstring 104 in a downhole direction 102 in the borehole 108. The conveyance means 112 may include at least one or more conductors (not shown) that facilitate data communication between the toolstring 104 and surface equipment 132 disposed at the wellsite surface 128, including through one or more slip rings, cables, and/or other conductors (schematically depicted in FIG. 1 by reference number 133) electrically connecting the one or more conductors of the conveyance means 112 with the surface equipment 132. The conveyance means 112 may alternatively transport the tool string without a conductor inside the cable but with at least one module that can autonomously acquire and/or process and/or store downhole measurements in downhole memory without human intervention or communication with the surface equipment 132.\\n[0018]\\nAlthough not illustrated as such in FIG. 1 , the winch 115 may be disposed on a service vehicle or a stationary skid/platform. The service vehicle or stationary skid/platform may also contain at least a portion of the surface equipment 132.\\n[0019]\\nThe toolstring 104 comprises a plurality of modules 136, one or more of which may comprise an elongated housing, mandrel, chassis, and/or structure carrying various electronic and/or mechanical components. For example, at least one of the modules 136 may be or comprise at least a portion of a device for measuring a feature and/or characteristic of the borehole 108, the casing 120, a tubular installed in the casing 120 (not shown), the cement 116, and/or the formation 124, and/or a device for obtaining sidewall or inline core and/or fluid (liquid and/or gas) samples from the borehole 108 and/or formation 124. Other implementations of the downhole toolstring 104 within the scope of the present disclosure may include additional or fewer components or modules 136 relative to the example implementation depicted in FIG. 1 .\\n[0020]\\nThe wellsite system 100 also includes a data processing system that may include at least a portion of one or more of the surface equipment 132, control devices and/or other electrical and/or mechanical devices in one or more of the modules 136 of the toolstring 104 (such as a downhole controller 140), a remote computer system (not shown), communication equipment, and/or other equipment. The data processing system may include one or more computer systems or devices and/or may be a distributed computer system. For example, collected data or information may be stored, distributed, communicated to a human wellsite operator, and/or processed locally (downhole or at surface) and/or remotely.\\n[0021]\\nThe data processing system may, whether individually or in combination with other system components, perform the methods and/or processes described below, or portions thereof. For example, the data processing system may include processor capability for collecting caliper, acoustic, ultrasonic, and/or other data related to the evaluation of the cement 116, the casing 120, a tubular installed in the casing 120 (not shown), and/or the formation 124, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Methods and/or processes within the scope of the present disclosure may be implemented by one or more computer programs that run in a processor located, for example, in one or more modules 136 of the toolstring 104 and/or the surface equipment 132. Such programs may utilize data received from the downhole controller 140 and/or other modules 136 and may transmit control signals to operative elements of the toolstring 104, where such communication may be via one or more electrical or optical conductors of the conveyance means 112. The programs may be stored on a tangible, non-transitory, computer-usable storage medium associated with the one or more processors of the downhole controller 140, other modules 136 of the toolstring 104, and/or the surface equipment 132, or may be stored on an external, tangible, non-transitory, computer-usable storage medium that is electronically coupled to such processor(s). The storage medium may be one or more known or future-developed storage media, such as a magnetic disk, an optically readable disk, flash memory, or a computer-readable device of another kind, including a remote storage device coupled over one or more wired and/or wireless communication links, among other examples.\\n[0022]\\nAs designated in FIG. 1 by reference number 138, at least one of the modules 136 may be or comprise a downhole ultrasonic measurement tool operable for acquiring acoustic measurements characterizing the borehole 108, the casing 120, a tubular installed in the casing 120 (not shown), the cement 116, and/or the formation 124. The downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138 comprises a phased array 139 of acoustic transducers (Òactive elementsÓ) that may each be operated as an acoustic transmitter and/or receiver. Example implementations of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138 within the scope of the present disclosure are described below.\\n[0023]\\nAs designated in FIG. 1 by reference number 142, another one (or more) of the modules 136 may be or comprise an orientation module permitting measurement of the azimuth of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138. Such module 142 may include, for example, one or more of a relative bearing (RB) sensor, a gravity/acceleration sensor, a magnetometer, and a gyroscopic sensor.\\n[0024]\\nAs designated in FIG. 1 by reference number 146, another one (or more) of the modules 136 may be or comprise a centralizer module. For example, the centralizer module 146 may comprise an electric motor driven by a controller (neither shown) and/or other means for actively extending (ÒopeningÓ) and retracting (ÒclosingÓ) a plurality of centralizing arms 147. Although only two centralizing arms 147 are depicted in the example implementation shown in FIG. 1 , other implementations within the scope of the present disclosure may have more than two centralizing arms 147. Extension of the centralizing arms 147 aids in urging the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138 to a central position within the casing 120, another tubular, or the borehole 108 being investigated by the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138. Implementations of toolstrings within the scope of the present disclosure may include more than one instance of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138 and/or more than one instance of the centralizer module 146. The modules 136 may be conveyed in either or both of open-hole sections 150 and cased-hole sections 155, including implementations in which the centralizer module 146 and the phased array module 138 may be configured or configurable for use in either or both of the two sections. The toolstring 104 may also not comprise the centralizer module 146, or may comprise another type of centralizer module, such as a passive centralizer module.\\n[0025]\\nFIG. 2 is a partial sectional view of at least a portion of an example implementation of a downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 shown in FIG. 2 is an example implementation of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 138 shown in FIG. 1 .\\n[0026]\\nThe downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 comprises an upper housing 204 and a lower housing 208. The upper and lower housings 204, 208 each comprise or are connected to corresponding interfaces for connecting the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 to adjoining modules of the tool string. The downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 also comprises a central member 212. The central member 212 is hollow to permit the passage of electrical conductors 253, such as wiring harnesses extending to other modules in the tool string. Alternatively, the central member 212 may be solid. In such implementations, no electrical conductors can pass, such as when the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 is the last tool in the toolstring (i.e., a Òbottom-onlyÓ tool).\\n[0027]\\nAn upper structure 216 connects the upper housing 204 to an upper portion 220 of the central member 212. A lower structure 224 connects the lower housing 208 to a lower portion 228 of the central member 212. Although the upper and lower structures 216, 224 are each depicted in FIG. 2 as a single, discrete component, this is merely for the purpose of clarity and ease of understanding on the present disclosure, it being understood that the upper and lower structures 216, 224 may each comprise two or more (perhaps several) discrete, interconnected components.\\n[0028]\\nThe downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 also comprises a backing 232. An intermediate portion 236 of the central member 212 extends longitudinally through the backing 232. A plurality of active elements 240 of a phased array are collectively disposed around a substantially cylindrical outer surface 244 of the backing 232. In the example implementation shown in FIG. 2 , several active elements 240 are depicted at different longitudinal positions but the same azimuthal positions. However, in other implementations within the scope of the present disclosure, just one active element 240 may be disposed around the backing 232 at one particular azimuthal position. The active elements 240 independently and cooperatively emit acoustic excitation signals and receive echo signals to perform downhole acoustic measurements as described herein. The active elements 240 are mechanically and electrically coupled to one or more substantially cylindrical inner surfaces of one or more circuit boards 248. Each circuit board 248 includes or is connected to a connector 249 that is connected to electronics 250 that are situated inside the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200, such as in the upper housing 240. A canister 252 surrounds the active elements 240.\\n[0029]\\nIn the example implementation depicted in FIG. 2 , the member 212 is a central member, but the position of the member 212 is not limited to the center of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200. Further, FIG. 2 depicts the acoustic measurement tool as being a tool comprising a phased array transducer, but the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 may have other configurations of transducers and still be within the scope of the present disclosure, including one transducer, a plurality of individual transducers separated from each other, and other example transducer implementations.\\n[0030]\\nDuring use downhole, the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 experiences axial (i.e., longitudinal) tension and compression forces that are transmitted to the upper and lower housings 204, 208. The tension forces are transmitted from the upper and lower housings 204, 208 to the central member 212 through the upper and lower structures 216, 224, respectively, as depicted in FIG. 2 by solid arrows (some being identified by reference number 256). The backing 232 is formed of a material with a low bulk modulus material, such as a mix of a polymer-type material (e.g., epoxy/silicone) that may be loaded with a certain volume-fraction of solid content (e.g., tungsten powder), or with a high bulk modulus material, such as a solid matrix material (e.g., metal) that may be filled with a filler material. The tensile strength of the material forming the backing 232 is generally not suitable for tension forces above various levels (e.g., above 1,000 Newtons (N)). The central member 212 is formed from steel, INCONEL, and/or other metals/metal alloys. As a consequence, the central member 212 is much more rigid than the backing 232, and the tensile axial forces 256 are transferred between the upper and lower housings 204, 208 via the central member 212 (through the upper and lower structures 216, 224) instead of through the backing 232, such that the backing 232 and the phased array components (including the active elements 240 and the one or more circuit boards 248) are not damaged by the axial loads.\\n[0031]\\nThe compression forces are transmitted from the upper and lower housings 204, 208 to the backing 232 through the upper and lower structures 216, 224, respectively, as depicted in FIG. 2 by dashed arrows (some being identified by reference number 260). Such arrangement distributes the forces so that the tool can withstand compression. In implementations in which the backing 232 is formed from a low bulk modulus material, the compressional force through the backing 232 also aids in balancing the radial compressional forces on the backing 232, such that its shape remains sufficiently stable so as to not damage the phased array (including the active elements 240 and the one or more circuit boards 248).\\n[0032]\\nAt least one of the upper and lower structures 216, 224 (e.g., the lower structure 216 in the example depicted in FIG. 2 ) has an axial (i.e., longitudinal) degree of freedom with respect to the central member 212 so that the compression forces are transmitted through the backing 232 and not through the central member 212 that may be damaged under compression. In other words, at least one of the upper and lower structures 216, 224 is able to move relative to the central member 212. Such movement is possible because the position of said structure is partially fixed relative to the position of the central member 212, i.e., there is no mechanical connection between the central member 212 and the structure that limits the movement of the structure along the tool axis under a compression movement. However, with regard to tensile forces, a mechanical feature (e.g., a nut or a shoulder) creates an end stop that limits the stroke of the structure under tension. In the example implementation depicted in FIG. 2 , just the lower structure 224 has an axial degree of freedom, which permits maintaining a controlled distance between the active elements and the electronics 250 in the upper housing 204, although the upper structure 216 may also be configured so as to have an axial degree of freedom relative to the central member 212.\\n[0033]\\nIn the example implementation depicted in FIG. 2 , the intermediate portion 236 of the central member 212 may comprise a flange and/or other protrusion 264 extending radially outward into a recess 268 in the otherwise substantially cylindrical inner surface 272 of the backing 232. Such protrusion 264 constrains the position of the upper structure 224 relative to the central member 212. The lower structure 224 abuts a downhole end 280 of the backing 232 but is not constrained relative to the central member 212 under compression. Thus, when the backing 232 deforms under compression, the axial (i.e., longitudinal) position of the lower structure 224 may change.\\n[0034]\\nSuch architecture of the transducer permits avoiding having to compensate the tool 200 for pressure differentials without constraining or damaging the transducer. There is therefore no need for the conventional oil-filling procedures, nor complex multi-pin bulkhead connectors connecting the phased array to the rest of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200.\\n[0035]\\nFIG. 3 is a sectional view of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200. In the example implementation depicted in FIG. 3 , the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 comprises six circuit boards 248. However, other implementations within the scope of the present disclosure include downhole ultrasonic measurement tools comprising other numbers of circuit boards 248. The example implementation of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 shown in FIG. 3 includes a row of eighteen active elements 240. However, just seven of the active elements 240 are fully shown in FIG. 3 , the remaining active elements 240 being hidden (removed from view) or shown by dashed lines for the sake of clarity.\\n[0036]\\nThe active elements 240 may be in direct contact with the outer cylindrical surface 244 of the backing 232, as shown in FIG. 2 . However, as depicted in FIG. 3 , a bonding layer 284 may interpose each active element 240 and the outer cylindrical surface 244 of the backing 232. FIG. 3 also depicts that a fill material 288 may be disposed (e.g., injected) into inter-element spaces 242 between the active elements 240. The fill material 288 may comprise materials similar to the backing 232, or simple polymer fillings without added solid content. However, the tool may not comprise the fill material 288, such as in implementations in which the active elements 240 are part of a same mechanical component where a plurality of sections are activated (e.g., polarized or plated) and separated with non-activated sections (e.g., non-conductive or not polarized).\\n[0037]\\nFIG. 4 is a sectional view of another example implementation of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 shown in FIG. 3 , designated in FIG. 4 by reference number 201. The downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 201 depicted in FIG. 4 may be substantially similar (or perhaps identical) to the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200 shown in FIG. 3 except as described below.\\n[0038]\\nFIG. 4 depicts that the active elements 240 may be embedded in the outer cylindrical surface 244 of the backing 232. For example, the active elements 240 may be fully embedded, such that they do not protrude outward beyond the outer cylindrical surface 244 of the backing 232, as depicted in FIG. 4 . However, in other implementations within the scope of the present disclosure, the active elements 240 may be just partially embedded, such that they do protrude outward beyond the outer cylindrical surface 244 of the backing 232. In such implementations, the fill material 288 may be disposed between the protruding portions of the active elements 240, as described above with respect to FIG. 3 .\\n[0039]\\nFIG. 4 also depicts that an inclusion-resistant layer 292 may be disposed between the phased array (e.g., the one or more circuit boards 248) and the canister 252. The inclusion-resistant layer 292 (or acoustic coupling layer) may be or comprise silicone and/or other materials such as epoxy or polyurethane for example that may reduce the risk of inclusions (e.g., air) during assembly of the sensor, such as during the fitting of the canister 252 onto the active elements 240. The canister 252 may be made of metal, as will be described in the following example. Alternatively, the canister 252 may be made of an elastomer, such as a shrinkable elastomer or polymer, for instance high-temperature plastic such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK).\\n[0040]\\nIn the example implementations depicted in FIGS. 2-4 , as well as other implementations within the scope of the present disclosure, the metal canister 252 protects the phased array components (e.g., the one or more circuit boards 248 and the active elements 240) from the corrosive environment of the borehole. Forming the canister 252 from metal (instead of the polymers conventionally used as a quarter-wavelength layer for ultrasonic transducer applications) also aids in preventing gas from migrating into the phased array from the outside environment. The metal canister 282 is thin enough to be acoustically transparent, yet also thick enough to support mechanical solicitations.\\n[0041]\\nThe canister 252 is configured to ensure very good contact with the active elements 240 so as to provide an acoustic path for ultrasonic signals and to prevent measurement-detrimental gas (air) inclusions into the phased array at pressures that are higher than ambient (i.e., atmospheric) pressure. Thus, whether or not the inclusion-resistant layer 292 exists, the canister 252 may be plastically deformed, in particular under high-pressure conditions, during assembly of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200/201. The material of the canister 252 has ductility, elongation, and strength properties that permit a permanent deformation of the canister 252 that will remain present throughout the entire operating envelope of the phased array. The permanent deformation of the canister 252 exerts sufficient force on the phased array to ensure adequate acoustic contact between the backing 232, the active elements 240, and the inclusion-resistant layer 292 (when existing), even in ambient pressure conditions. In other implementations, the canister 252 may be made of shape memory alloy (SMA) material that changes in crystalline arrangement when subjected to extreme conditions, such as high temperature. The canister 252 may be configured so that, in its borehole configuration, it is in very good contact with the active elements 240. This may be achieved by placing the canister 252 in a first configuration, where it can be assembled around the active elements 240, and then subjecting the canister 252 to the above-mentioned extreme conditions so that it takes a second, more compact, configuration in which the very good contact is achieved. Thus, the proper functioning of the phased array is not dependent upon a certain pressure differential, in contrast to conventional acoustic transducers.\\n[0042]\\nThe above-described design aspects of the active elements 240 assembled with the flexible circuit board(s) 248 also aid in permitting the elimination of pressure-compensation, such as due to their flat interfaces and the lack of wires creating relief. The flexible nature of the circuit board(s) 248 is attained by forming the circuit board(s) 248 from flexible silicon, polyimide, PEEK, transparent conductive polyester film, and/or other flexible materials. FIG. 5 is a perspective view of at least a portion of an example implementation of a circuit board assembly 300 that may be or comprise one of the circuit boards 248 depicted in FIGS. 2-4 .\\n[0043]\\nAs shown in FIG. 5 , the circuit board 248 includes a plurality of circuit traces 304. The traces 304 are schematically depicted in FIG. 5 , it being understood that the actual paths of the traces 304 vary among implementations within the scope of the present disclosure. The traces 304 are connected at one end to the active elements 240. The traces 304 can contain both signal and ground paths. However, if the backing 232 is conductive or has a conductive layer on the outer surface 244, ground can be obtained directly from connection of each active element 240 to the backing 232.\\n[0044]\\nThe circuit board 248 includes or is connected to a portion 308 extending radially inward (i.e., toward the central member 212), another portion 312 extending longitudinally within the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200, and perhaps one or more additional portions 316 routing the traces 304 to one or more connectors 320. As shown in the example implementation depicted in FIG. 5 , the connector 320 may include openings 324 through which fasteners (not shown) may extend for securing the connector 320 to acquisition electronics of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200, as well as a plurality of pins, sockets, and/or other electrical connection means 328 that are electrically connected to corresponding ones of the traces 304.\\n[0045]\\nFIG. 6 is a perspective view of at least a portion of an example implementation of active elements 402 of a phased array 400 according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The phased array 400 shown in FIG. 6 is an example implementation of the phased arrays described above. The phased array 400 permits obtaining azimuthal measurements relative to the borehole without rotation of the downhole ultrasonic measurement tool 200.\\n[0046]\\nThe example phased array 400 depicted in FIG. 6 comprises active elements 402 arranged in eight rows 404 and 48 columns 406 extending around a central axis 408. However, implementations of the phased array 400 and other phased arrays within the scope of the present disclosure may include different numbers (including one) of rows 404 and/or columns 406. The phased array 400 may be configured such that the transducer elements 402 are collectively disposed azimuthally around a substantial portion (e.g., more than 50%) of the tool, perhaps the entire periphery of the tool.\\n[0047]\\nIn view of the entirety of the present application, including the figures and the claims, a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the present disclosure introduces an apparatus that includes a downhole acoustic measurement tool comprising: (A) at least one transducer operable for emitting acoustic excitation signals and/or receiving echo signals to perform downhole measurements; (B) a backing in contact with an inner surface of the at least one transducer; (C) a first structure mechanically coupled to a first housing; (D) a second structure mechanically coupled to a second housing; and (E) a longitudinally extending member comprising: (i) a first portion mechanically coupled to the first structure; (ii) a second portion mechanically coupled to the second structure, wherein at least one of the first and second structures is mechanically coupled to the member and thereby has a longitudinal degree of freedom relative to the member; and (iii) a third portion extending longitudinally through the backing between the first and second portions such that compressional longitudinal forces experienced by \", 'top_terms': \"['transducer', 'downhole', 'backing', 'canister', 'acoustic', 'active elements', 'phased array', 'tool', 'present disclosure', 'measurement tool']\", 'embedding': '[-0.07255668, -0.36741617, -0.0038597977, -0.0016488923, 0.004528452, -0.003824706, 0.09417781, -0.11347075, 0.16115744, -0.14590952, -0.122098856, 0.033075064, -0.11634154, -0.009694001, -0.10338899, 0.035116162, 0.15657789, 0.24273115, -0.24882093, 0.056609854, 0.16378865, -0.08769187, -0.27746361, 0.031776894, 0.16553353, 0.01703459, 0.040418163, 0.0018193288, -0.032495324, 0.04201615, 0.17574742, 0.047698714, 0.016098468, -0.13618574, 0.071777515, 0.05415735, 0.09688615, -0.19423182, 0.07730795, -0.07624818, -0.089191, -0.22480568, -0.041324414, -0.09594039, -0.15349792, -0.08044699, 0.02397071, 0.13393797, 0.016333247, -0.013158909, 0.06742112, 0.045348607, -0.049478, 0.11806577, -0.010905993, 0.12436295, 0.058338076, 0.02522138, -0.055695154, 0.028267497, 0.0055478094, 0.26384225, -0.3005906, 0.10978245]', 'cpc': 'G01V1/52, E21B47/107, G01N29/043, G01N29/225, G01N29/227, G01N29/262, G01N29/265, G01N29/28, G01V1/46, G01V1/523, G01N2291/044, G01V2001/526, G01V2210/121, G01V2210/1299, G01V2210/1429', 'definitions': 'Structural details, Locating fluid leaks, intrusions or movements using acoustic means, Analysing solids in the interior, e.g. by shear waves, Supports, positioning or alignment in moving situation, Details, e.g. general constructional or apparatus details related to high pressure, tension or stress conditions, Arrangements for orientation or scanning by relative movement of the head and the sensor by electronic orientation or focusing, e.g. with phased arrays, Arrangements for orientation or scanning by relative movement of the head and the sensor by moving the sensor relative to a stationary material, Details, e.g. general constructional or apparatus details providing acoustic coupling, e.g. water, Data acquisition, Damping devices, Internal reflections (echoes), e.g. on walls or defects, Mounting of transducers, Active source, Subsurface, e.g. in borehole or below weathering layer or mud line, Subsurface, e.g. in borehole or below weathering layer or mud line', 'forward cites': nan, 'backward cites': nan}), Document(page_content='US-9797235-B2', metadata={'abstract': 'Optimizing the operation of a hydraulically powered rotor and stator driven drill as it drills a wellbore into the earth is described.

The downhole motor, sometimes referred to as a mud motor, is positioned at the bottom of a drillstring and coupled via an output shaft with a drill bit. Drilling fluid, sometimes referred to as drilling mud or simply mud, is pumped down the drillstring and through the downhole motor. The downhole motor uses the force of the pumped/flowing drilling fluid to produce a mechanical output, a rotation of the output shaft and, in turn, the drill bit.\\nAlthough there are different types of downhole/mud motors, the most commonly used type today is a positive displacement motor which uses an elongated, helically-shaped rotor within a corresponding helically shaped stator. The flow of drilling fluid or mud between the stator and rotor causes the rotor to orbit within the stator eccentrically about the longitudinal axis of the stator. The rotor itself rotates about its longitudinal axis and also orbits around the central longitudinal axis of the stator. This eccentric orbit and rotation of the rotor is transferred by a suitable transmission assembly, such as a universal joint assembly, to produce a concentric rotation for the output shaft.\\nThe downhole motor is a kind of downhole dynamic drilling tool that converts the power of drilling mud to a rotation of the drill bit; an application of torque and speed to the drill bit. The advantages of using a downhole motor is that it provides: an increased rate of penetration; better hole deviation control; reduced drill string failure rate.\\nA downhole motor, mud motor or drilling motor may also be referred to as a Progressive Cavity Positive Displacement Pump that may be disposed on the drillstring to provide additional power to the bit during a drilling process. As described above, the downhole motor uses the drilling fluid to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor, which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit. The downhole motor uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation; typically the number of lobes and the length of power assembly may be increased to provide greater horsepower. In certain applications, compressed air or other compressed gases may be used to input power to the downhole motor. A rotation of the bit while using a downhole motor may be from about 60 rpm to over 100 rpm.\\nDownhole motors may comprise a top sub, which connects the downhole motor to the drillstring; the power section, which consists of the rotor and the stator; the transmission section, where the eccentric power from the rotor is transmitted as concentric power to the bit; the bearing assembly which protects the tool from off bottom and on bottom pressures; and the bottom sub which connects the downhole motor to the bit.\\nThe use of downhole motors is greatly dependent on financial efficiency. In straight vertical holes, the mud motor may be used for increased rate of penetration (ROP), or to minimize erosion and wear on the drill string, since the drill string does not need to be turned as fast. However, the majority of downhole motor use is for directional drilling. Although other methods may be used to steer the drill to directionally drill a borehole, a downhole motor may be the most cost effective method.\\nIn some aspects, the downhole motor may be configured to have include a bend section to provide for directional drilling. Typically, downhole motors can be modified in a range of around zero to four degrees to provide for directional drilling with approximately six increments in deviation per degree of bend. The amount of bend is determined by rate of climb needed to reach the target zone. By using a measurement while drilling (MWD) Tool, a directional driller can steer the bit, which is driven by the downhole motor, to the desired target zone.\\nThe power section of the downhole motor consists of the stator and the rotor. In certain downhole motors, the stator comprises a rubber sleeve on the wall of a steel tube, where the inside of the rubber sleeve defines a spiral structure with a certain geometric parameter. The rotor comprises a shaft, such as a steel shaft, that may be coated with a wear resistant coating, such as chrome and may have a helical profile configured to run/turn/rotate inside the stator.\\nIn the drilling procedure, drilling fluid is pumped downhole through the drill pipe at a given rate and pressure. The downhole motor converts the hydraulic energy of the drilling fluid passing through the power section into mechanical energy, rotation and torque. This mechanical energy is transferred from the downhole motor to the drill bit.\\nAn alternative to using a positive displacement motor is to employ a turbine, in a process often referred to as turbodrilling. In the turbodrill method, power is generated at the bottom of the hole by mud-operated turbines. The turbodrill consists of four basic components: the upper, or thrust, bearing; the turbines, the lower bearing; and the bit. In operation, mud is pumped through the drill pipe, passing through the thrust bearing and into the turbine. In the turbine, stators attached to the body of the tool divert the mud flow onto the rotors attached to the shaft. This causes the shaft, which is connected to the bit, to rotate. The mud passes through a hollow part of the shaft in the lower bearing and through the bit, as in rotary drilling, to remove cuttings, cool the bit, and perform the other functions of the drilling fluid. The capacity of the mud, which is the power source, determines rotational speed.\\nMultistage high efficiency reaction turbine blades extract hydrolic energy from the flowing mud stream and convert it to mechanical energy (torque and rotation) to drive the drill bit. Each turbine stage consists of a stator, fixed to the body of the tool, and a rotor fixed to the output shaft. These are designed to work in unison, directing and accelerating the mud as it passes through each stage. To achieve the high power and torque levels necessary in performance drilling applications, complete tools are built with approximately 150 sets of identical rotor and stator pairs. To ensure a long life the rotors and stators are manufactured using high performance alloys, which are resistant to both erosion and corrosion.\\nSimilar to a positive displacement motor, the turbodrill generates mechanical power through a pressure drop across the drive system coupled with the fluid flow rate. Generally, the greater the pressure drop capacity of the tool, the greater the potential for delivering mechanical power to the bit. Because the turbodrill power generation system is entirely mechanic, it is capable of supporting an extremely high pressure drop that creates greater mechanical power compared with a mud motor.\\nIn view of their benefits positive displacement motors (PDMs) and turbines are used prolifically in oilfield drilling operations to increase the rotary speed and torque supplied to the bit during drilling.\\nAlthough widely used in oilfield drilling operation, the performance of the downhole motor how, such as much rotary speed and torque is generated in the downhole motor during a downhole drilling operation, is generally unknown. Manufacturers of the motors do provide a guide to the performance of the motor. These guides can take the form of a chart relating the torque and rotation speed of the rotor as a function of pressure drop across the motor of the fluid driving the motor. As such, performance of the downhole motor may be estimated by a response chart and the measured pressure drop. However these charts are generated under surface conditions and using an ideal fluid such as water and so may not accurately reflect the performance of the downhole motor under downhole conditions, wear, when being driven by non-water fluids and/or the like. Consequently, an operator of a downhole motor may not know how the downhole motor is operating and/or how best to operate the downhole motor.\\nDuring a downhole drilling operation the downhole conditions give rise to a wide variety of sources of deviation from the manufacturer's performance charts. Such sources of deviation include extremes of temperature and pressure, variation in the properties of the drilling mud, wear of the motor and associated components. All of these can influence the performance of the motor and result in the manufacturer's charts losing accuracy.\\nDrilling operators in the field are aware of this source of deviation and as a result do not rely on the accuracy of manufacturer's performance charts. As such they tend to drill more conservatively than the charts would indicate were possible, to avoid pushing the drill beyond the point of optimal performance and risk stalling the drill. The effect of this is that downhole motors and turbines are generally operated sub-optimally, operating below the maximum power output and efficiency possible.\\nAdditionally, the speed of rotation of the drilling motor or turbine may be extremely important in controlling the direction of drilling of the drilling system, ROP, stability of the drilling system, vibration of the drilling system, effectiveness of the drilling system and/or the like. As such, to effectively operate a drilling system using a downhole motor in essentially real-time it is important to determine the rotational properties of the downhole motor or turbine.\\nFurthermore, published manufacture curves are often not available for turbines and drillers have only theoretical approximations as to the turbine's speed or power output, making their efficient operation even more problematic.\\nSUMMARY\\nIn a first aspect, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of optimising the operation of a hydraulically or pneumatically powered rotor and stator driven drill as it drills a wellbore into the earth, the method comprising:\\n(a) measuring a first set of rotor and stator operating parameters including the speed of rotation of the rotor and rotor torque for a first period of time,\\n(b) generating a first set of relationships from the first set of operating parameters to enable the rotor speed and rotor torque to be predicted over a range of operating parameter values,\\n(c) determining from the relationships a first more optimal mode of operation,\\n(d) changing at least one operating parameter to move the operation of the rotor and stator towards the more optimal mode of operation.\\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, measurements, either made directly or indirectly, are made of the operating parameters of the downhole rotor and stator and used to generate predictive performance relationships from the downhole measured parameters. These predictive relationships may then be used in place of manufacturers charts, as they have been obtained by taking into account all of the sources of deviation from the manufacturers charts for the time period specified.\\nSuch relationships are therefore based on real data and the only sources of error are the accuracy of the measurements made and how well the relationships fit the measured data.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\nEmbodiments of the present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following examples and with reference to the following drawings in which:\\nFIG. 1 is a chart showing the torque of a downhole rotor as a function of differential pressure across the rotor, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 2 is a chart of the rotation speed of the rotor as a function of differential pressure across the rotor at three different drilling mud flow rates, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 3a is a chart of the torque measured on the rotor of a turbine as a function of rotational speed, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 3b is a chart of the power generated by the turbine of FIG. 3a as a function of rotational speed, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 3c is a chart showing the measured rotational speed of the turbine as a function of flow rate of drilling mud through the turbine, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.\\nFIG. 4 shows a variety of charts showing the torque, speed and resulting power output of a drilling motor as a function of differential pressure across the rotor, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

However, other rotor and stator arrangements are also possible.\\nThe rotor can be hydraulically or pneumatically powered. This is carried out by application of a fluid, either a liquid or a gas, which transmits power to the rotor. In the downhole motor the rotor/turbine is driven to rotate by a fluid flowing through the motor and this rotation is used to drive the drill to drill a borehole.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, the operating parameters of the downhole motor may be made directly or inferred from other measurements.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, the measurements to be made may vary but it is required that at least a direct or indirect measurement of the speed of rotation of the rotor and of the torque provided by the rotor, is required.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, a direct measurement of the speed of the motor can be made downhole in the vicinity of the motor and can be carried out by any known method in the art. However, if this is not possible, then indirect methods can be employed to infer the rotation speed such as by monitoring vibration of the downhole motor.\\nIn general, in some embodiments of the present invention, all measurements are made downhole, in order that the downhole conditions are accurately established and/or the operation of thew downhole motor under this conditions established. However, this is not always possible, and in certain aspects, some downhole parameters and operation characteristics of the downhole motor may be inferred from measurements made at the surface.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, in some cases, the measurements may be combined with any prior measurements or data, in order to infer the measurement desired. Examples of such earlier measurements include dynamometer tests or previous bit runs.\\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, one important measured operating parameter is the torque produced by the rotor. In some aspects, the torque can be measured directly and downhole e.g. by use of a strain gauge. However, in other aspects, the torque can be inferred from a measurement of torque of the drillstring measured at the surface.\\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the torque measured at the surface can be thought of as having two components; i.e. the torque driving the drill bit per se and the frictional forces experienced by the outer casing of the drill string as it rotates in the wellbore. Thus, in one embodiment, by operating the drill Òoff-bottom,Ó the torque measured at the surface can be taken to be equal to the well friction component. Once known, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, any measured increase in torque at the surface from this base point during drilling can be taken to be due to torque applied to the drill bit generated by the motor downhole. This is therefore an example of an indirect measurement of torque, combining the torque measured at the surface with a prior measurement of frictional torque when the drill was off-bottom in order to infer the torque generated by the rotor and stator.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, other operating parameters which are important to measure include the hydraulic power transmitted to the rotor. In one embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic power transmitted to the rotor can be measured by separately measuring the pressure drop of the mud due to energy transfer to the rotor and measuring the flow rate of the mud through the rotor and stator.\\nIn some embodiments, the pressure drop of mud due to energy transfer to the motor can be inferred from surface measurements of pressure. This is because the pressure at the surface sometimes referred to as the Òstandpipe pressureÓ can be taken as made up at two components. The first component is the frictional pressure lost in pumping the mud down the drill string, through the motor and back up the annulus. The second component is the additional pressure lost due to energy transfer to the motor. Thus, if the first component can be estimated, then the second component, which is the measurement of interest, can be inferred from the standpipe pressure measurement.\\nOnce the measurements have been made, in embodiments of the present invention, the next step in the method is to establish relationships from the measured data. One relationship is the relationship between the torque generated by the rotor (T) and the pressure drop due to hydraulic energy transfer to the rotor _P.\\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, it can be shown, for example, for a positive displacement motor, that to a first approximation:\\nT=a_P\\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, from measurements of T and _P the constant ÒaÓ can be processed, for example by regression techniques or the like. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, once the constant ÒaÓ is found then the relationship between T and _P is derived. In embodiments of the present invention, other relationships concerning the operation of the downhole motor may be employed provided that sufficient measurements are made to enable the unknown values of the constants to be determined.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, another relationship used to characterize the operation of the downhole motor is the relationship between the speed of rotation of the rotor (S) and the pressure drop due to hydraulic energy transfer to the rotor (_P). In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, it can be shown, for example, that for a positive displacement motor, that to a first approximation:\\nS=a 1 _P 2 +a 2 Q\\nwhen a1 and a2 are constants and Q is the flow rate of drilling mud. As such, in one embodiment of the present invention, from measurements of S, _P and Q, the constants a1 and a2 may be processed, for example by regression techniques or the like. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, establishing these relationships enables both the torque and speed to be known and predicted for a given pressure drop and flow rate of mud.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, rotor torque and speed are of particular relevance because it is these parameters which are provided by the motor manufacturer to characterize operation of the downhole motor. Thus, in embodiments of the present invention, an accurate model of torque and speed is obtained from actual measured data in real-time.\\nAs discussed above, in embodiments of the present invention, once the relationships for operation of a downhole motor are established, the next step is to employ the relationships to determine an optimal mode of operation of the downhole motor.\\nTypically, it will be desirable to operate the motor or turbine to maximise the mechanical power generated. As is known to the person skilled in the art, the power delivered by the motor or turbine can be given by the product of the torque generated and the speed of rotation of the rotor. Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, by combining the torque and speed relationships, a relationship for mechanical power can be obtained and a more optimal, i.e. greater mechanical power, operating point can be determined.\\nIn order to move towards the more optimal mode of operation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an operating parameter may be adjusted. In certain aspects, the parameters to be adjusted may be chosen from, for example, weight applied to the drill bit, rotation speed of the drill string and flow rate of mud through the drill and motor. Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the relationships can be transmitted to the a surface drilling operator so that he can make as assessment of the current drilling performance and the location of a more optimal mode of operation.\\nFor example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an increase in weight-on-bit may be used to provide an increase in torque generated by the motor, provided that the motor does not stall. Likewise, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an increase in mud flow rate may be used to increase the torque generated by the motor, subject to other constraints in the system on mud flow rate.\\nAlternatively, in some embodiments of the present invention, the relationships and current operating performance can be used to feed into an automated control apparatus to adjust operating parameters in order to move towards the more optimal mode of operation. Once the more optimal mode of operation has been arrived at, the relationships employed to get there may, however, no longer be entirely accurate. This is because the motor may now be operating based on extrapolated performance from the predictive relationships.\\nTherefore, in some embodiments, once at the first more optimal mode of operation, the method of some embodiments of the present invention is carried out again to measure a second set of rotor and stator operating parameters, generate a second set of relationships to determine a second more optimal mode of operation, and to alter the operating parameters to move towards the second more optimal mode of operation.\\nIf necessary or advantageous, the method of the invention discussed above can be repeated again or as often as desired, until no further optimisation of the performance of the rotor are found.\\nAs described above, such repeated action can be carried out manually by a skilled drilling operator or, for example, as part of an automated control scheme. However, even when the most optimal mode of operation has been arrived at, the method of the invention can provide further benefits and advantages as drilling progresses.\\nAs the drill continues to drill into the earth, the performance of the rotor and stator can change with time. This can be due to a number of factors such as changes in temperature and pressure or a change in the properties of the drilling mud. Additionally the motor may experience wear and its performance affected accordingly. Thus, certain embodiments of the present invention can also be used to monitor the performance of the drill as drilling progresses, acting as a diagnostics tool, e.g. for mechanical failure.\\nThus, once the more optimal mode of operation has been found, such changes to the performance of the drill may result in a shifting of the more optional mode of operation as drilling progresses. Such changes may be gradual, e.g. in the case of mechanical wear or changes in temperature and pressure, or can be sudden, e.g. in the case of mechanical failure or a change in the lithography of the rock being drilled into.\\nIn some embodiments, even after the most optimal mode of operation may have been determined, the method of the invention as discussed above may be carried out again at a later period of time i.e. when the drill has progressed further into the earth. This will result in a further set of measured operating parameters, which may be employed to generate a further set of relationships for use in controlling/monitoring operation of the downhole motor. The further set of relationships may indicate a new further more optimal mode of operation. The operating parameters can then be altered to move towards this new further mode of operation.\\nAs before, the steps of measuring and finding a more optimal mode of operation can be carried out repeatedly until no further more optimal modes of operation can be found. Thus, in some embodiments, the method can be repeated as often as desired. In one embodiment, the measured parameters and relationships in the method discussed above are continuously updated in real-time as the drill proceeds.\\nThus, embodiments of the present invention can provide a real-time determination of the hydraulic performance of the rotor and stator, to enable continuous adjustment, optimisation and/or diagnostics as drilling progresses.\\nA field test was performed at the Schlumberger Cameron Test Facility. The purpose of the test was to use real-time downhole measurements to study the performance of drilling motors and turbines, to optimize the operation of the drill.\\nThe field experiment used a bottom-hole apparatus (BHA). The BHA was connected to a 6_ PDC bit. Above this bit was at least one of a mud motor and a 4_ inch turbine with blades. This was connected via a probe to a measuring-while-drilling (ÒMWDÓ) tool. The MWD tool was modified to determine the speed and position of the shaft of the motor or turbine and to transmit it to the surface in real-time. In addition, the BHA was fitted with a drilling dynamics board (ÒDDBÓ), a compact board containing multiple sensors, power and memory. DDBs were placed at three locations along the BHA: in the bit, in the collar of the motor or turbine, and in a short sub placed directly above the MWD. Nine BHAs were run during the experiment that tested both the motor and turbine, as well as a number of different bits and stabilizer positions.\\nThe MWD tool was used during the test as its modular architecture meant it was fast to implement the modifications necessary to measure motor speed. The tool attached to a rigid ÒprobeÓ that screwed into a small bore made in the top of the rotor catcher that connects to the top of either the motor or turbine. During the experiment, the probe ran inside a stabilizer that sat between the motor/turbine and the MWD tool.\\nThe angular position and rotation speed of the probe was measured by the MWD tool using two magnets and an induction coil. These signals were transmitted to the surface in real-time using the MWD's emag link as well as being stored to the tool's memory at 600 Hz sample rate. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the real-time signals generated in the test provided new/never-before-seen information on the performance of the motor and turbine and were essential in constructing the performance characteristics and real-time optimization discussed in the following sections.\\nIn embodiments of the present invention, provided the drillstring is rotating and assuming that wellbore friction is constant, the torque at the motor and the differential pressure across it can be estimated from surface measurements of drilistring torque and pump pressure respectively. This may be done by subtracting out the off-bottom values of these measurements when drilling. Using this procedure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the relationship between motor torque and differential pressure in real-time may be generated. An example of this processing is shown in FIG. 1. In the test of the methods in accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, it was found that the torque generated by the downhole motor was less than that predicted by the published curves (generated by surface tests) supplied with the downhole motor.\\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, to construct a model of motor speed, downhole measurements are required. During the field test, the downhole measurements were made using the MWD system described above. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, because motor speed is a function of mud flow, the relationship between speed and differential pressure was examined at different flow rates.\\nAn example of this is shown in FIG. 2. As can be seen from this example, the measured speed from the motor was often 10-20% higher than predicted by the published motor performance curves. Also, the roll-off (the rate at which the motor speed drops with increasing differential pressure) was significantly less severe than predicted.\\nDrilling tur\", 'top_terms': \"['rotor', 'motor',
